    <p class="main-description">“[A]bashedly self-conscious and evocative, capacious yet taut lyricism… [Rivkin]
        constructs desire as the cornerstone of autobiographical poetry…This collection doesn’t just present intimacy,
        it dramatizes the difficulty of even talking about intimacy.” <a

            Baker Saltmarsh, Georgia Review</a></p>
    <a href=""></a>
    <p class="main-description">“Rivkin’s deft play with image, memory, and form provides readers a fascinating mode of
        meditation. The book is generous in its vision and openness, and strong in its assertion that all relationships
        are complex — whether they are with family, time, language, or knowing itself.” <a

            Dudek, Kenyon Review</a></p>

    <p class="main-description">“An expansive rumination on the self, what it means to succeed those who came before
        you, as well as the pursuit of desire.” <a

    <p class="main-description">“Poetry is Joshua Rivkin’s art, but he approaches it with the keen observational powers
        of a scientist.” <a

        “This strong debut rigorously and restlessly addresses human desire.”

    <p class="main-description">
        “Unbeknownst to us, we have been awaiting a book like Joshua Rivkin’s Suitor, a book for our times, of such
        astonishing candor and wicked, sharp seeing into the inscrutable nature of maleness in our times. Driven by a
        probing intellect, the poems here, principled in song, at once heartbreakingly unveil and render complex our
        current crisis of manhood, whose only resolution lies in such tender, focused, and incisive language. Reading
        this book, I assure you, will broadly awaken you to your own journey or someone sitting next to you, and then,
        that person next to them.”
        <span>—Major Jackson, author of Roll Deep and Hoops</span>

    <p class="main-description">
        “For opulence of imagination and spareness of language, for musical savvy and analytical rigor, for a frankness
        that is both tender and unnerving in its nakedness, Joshua Rivkin’s Suitor is one of the best books of poetry,
        let alone first books, that I’ve read in a very long time. His prose meditation about his father and the moral
        culpability of the scientist, his lyrics about sex as a blueprint of the psyche, and his nuanced understanding
        of how children and parents create the story under the story of our civilization, is mature, formally masterful,
        and refreshingly free of moralizing cant, blame, or the desire to shame. Best of all, for all its tough-minded
        skepticism, it’s a book replete with an undeluded hopefulness.”
        <a href="">

    <p class="main-description">
        “In Suitor, Joshua Rivkin’s field of vision is lyrically sweeping, moving through a mother’s series of
        boyfriends, to the pursuit of revisitations with a father known ‘best by departures and arrivals,’ to
        revisionist history, the speaker’s own suitors—as well as the speaker as suitor, a word which comes ‘from the
        Latin secutor, to follow.’ Here is a tenderly quiet and rigorous study on human behavior in familial,
        historical, and domestic spaces—of the body, the house, of intimacy and legacy. Like a tinkerer with a delicate
        touch, Rivkin attempts to untangle the knots of a kite unspooled—’a kite / caught in a tree high above ground /
        and there’s no way to bring it down / without breaking it or the branches.’ Yet what is ruptured in these poems
        is also a site of connection: of rendering what is lost over time and regained in memory as a bridge between the
        self and the world around him; Rivkin’s presence and awareness are tremendous gifts. He does not ‘tal[k] around
        anything,’ rather, he moves and bears witness across time, in and though bodies, tender moments of love, lust,
        and disappointment. The ‘past is not forgotten’ and the ‘story doesn’t change,’ but Rivkin’s sightline is always
        honest, seeking, and true. His is an astonishing debut.”

    <p class="main-description">
        “In this dreamlike, lifelike gem of a book, Joshua Rivkin opens us to our deepest humanity, which is to say our
        deepest desire and fallibility and want. Suitor is a book of so many selves, all wanting . . . what? Connection
        may be one word for it, but, it seems to me, the mystery of what we truly wish for is the beating heart and
        restless soul of this book. With critical rigor and rigorous heart, Joshua Rivkin holds the mirror to the whole
        burning trouble of what we’re willing to do to call the thing we most want ours. Sometimes the answer is
        nothing. Sometimes the answer is burn the world down. This book is a secret and a marvel. I think it’s what we
        mean by confession, if we’re really honest with ourselves. Which, this book seems to remind us, we so rarely
        are.”

        <br>
        <br>
        I say you and mean our life together<br>
        will be a picturesque postcard
        <br>
        <br>
        from the Cape of Good Cheer,<br>
        the Cape of Wonder.
        <br>
        <br>
        Other days it will be a typhoon,<br>
        warm waters gathered into storm.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am divided<br>
        and unsure in so many things
        <br>
        <br>
        except this:<br>
        the end of every suitor is rest.
        <br>
        <br>
        To touch the hem of your dress<br>
        or the seam of your suit
        <br>
        <br>
        and leave it. The body waits.<br>
        We have the serious business
        <br>
        <br>
        of living: unpack the boxes<br>
        of books and unroll newspaper
        <br>
        <br>
        from glasses, fill the cabinets<br>
        with bowls and measuring cups.
        <br>
        <br>
        We invite our friends.<br>
        Join us. We’ve made a place at our table,
        <br>
        <br>
        the table we bought at the flea market<br>
        and carried five blocks home.
        <br>
        <br>
        I set it with your plates<br>
        and my silverware.
