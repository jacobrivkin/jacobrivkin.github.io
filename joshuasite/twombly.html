            MOST IMPORTANT AND INFLUENTIAL ARTISTS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Cy Twombly was a man obsessed with myth and history—including his own. Shuttling between his stunning homes in
        Italy and the United States, where he perfected his room-size canvases, he managed his public image carefully
        and rarely gave interviews. Upon first seeing Twombly’s remarkable paintings, author Joshua Rivkin became
        obsessed himself with the mysterious artist, and began chasing every lead, big or small—anything that might
        illuminate who Twombly really was. Now, after unprecedented archival research and years of interviews, Rivkin
        has reconstructed Twombly’s life, from his time at the legendary Black Mountain College, to his canonization in
        a 1994 MoMA retrospective; from his heady explorations of Rome in the 1950s with Robert Rauschenberg, to the
        ongoing efforts to shape his legacy after his death. Including previously unpublished photographs, Chalk
        presents a more personal and searching type of biography than we’ve ever encountered, and brings to life a more
        complex Twombly than we’ve ever known.

            “When he is talking about Twombly’s art, or the book’s larger themes of evasiveness and evanescence, you
            stop hearing the thwarted reporter and start hearing the poet, who approaches this art as a gold mine of
            metaphors and symbols, and finds the experience enrapturing…..propulsive, positive and persuasive.”<br>

            “[Rivkin’s] writing about Twombly has, at its center, a deeply personal and, subsequently, moral character
            to it that extends beyond academic interest, and into visceral desperation… He is meticulous in tracking
            down and interrogating the entire pool of available research, presenting it to the reader in clear, precise
            prose… It’s as if the readers, alongside the author, are seeking to solve Twombly, to understand what
            motivated him and how he saw the world.”

            traces the difficulties of tracking down the man as thoroughly as it fills in the blurred, half-erased

            “This book is a network of glances, an architecture of mirrors and hallways, all in pursuit of a ‘figure in
            the
            carpet’ — the mysterious Twombly and the haunting scrawl of his beautiful paintings.”

        <li>
            “CHALK is so much more than a study of the life and work of the famously-guarded painter Cy Twombly. At its
            heart,
            this is a book about desire: desire to bridge the distances between ourselves and others, desire to overcome
            the
            fear of being seen, and underneath it all the desire we all share to be recognized as our true selves by at
            least
            one person we love. At once both candid and tender, meditative and unsparing, CHALK leads readers on a
            journey made
            all the more riveting by the narrative impossibility of its premise: a search for the larger-than-life
            artist by the
            writer who pursues but will never meet him, and the overwhelming need to tell a story written over with
            silences.
            This book is a gift to Twombly devotees and newcomers alike — as imbued with beauty, genius, and vitality as
            the
            artist’s work that is its subject.”
