About the FF Meta typefaces
German type designer Erik Spiekermann, created this sans FontFont between 1991 and 2010. The family has 28 weights, ranging from Hairline to Black in Condensed and Normal (including italics) and is ideally suited for advertising and packaging, book text, editorial and publishing, logo, branding and creative industries, small text as well as web and screen design. Starting with these fonts as the basis, Marianna Paszkowska of Monotype produced this variable font in 2018 to encompass both weight and italic axes.
