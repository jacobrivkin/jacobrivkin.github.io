            For the short documentary film <i><a href="https://www.documentaries.org/films/ten-times-better/">Ten Times Better</a></i>, I animated two hand-drawn segments featuring George Lee's rigorous dance training in Shanghai as a young child and later in New York, showing the ballet move which no one else could perform. Work included storyboarding, animation, and color.

            <h2>Film Synopsis</h2>
            <p class="project-page-text">
            George Lee is an 88-year-old blackjack dealer who still works five days a week, a beloved figure in the pit of a downtown Las Vegas casino. None of the card players—and few of his coworkers—know of this humble man’s astonishing background: a child dance prodigy and refugee from Shanghai who became a teenage sensation in the original staging of George Balanchine’s <i>The Nutcracker</i> exactly 70 years ago, performing the “Tea” divertissement. George’s story is uniquely American: an immigrant striving to prove himself as an Asian pioneer in ballet and on Broadway, where he was cast by Gene Kelly for the original production of <i>Flower Drum Song</i>. The film is a tale of talent and perseverance in the face of hardship, and a reminder of the extraordinary stories behind the nameless faces all around us.
