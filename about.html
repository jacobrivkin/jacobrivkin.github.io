            <p>These <a class="inner" href="poems.html">poems</a> were generated by webscraping the forums of <a class="inner"href="https://www.contractortalk.com/forums/">Contractor Talk </a>and <a class="inner" href="https://www.skyscrapercity.com/forums">Skyscraper City</a>. The resulting text was parsed by a natural language processing searching for combinations of grammar based on patterning found in <a class="inner"href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45521/i-wandered-lonely-as-a-cloud">William Wordsworth's <span class="it">I wandered lonely as a cloud</span></a>. These remaining phrases were recombined together to form new poems and meditations on the idea of building within the natural world.</p>
