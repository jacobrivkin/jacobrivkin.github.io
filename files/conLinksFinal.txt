Jet and DeWalt have them too.
I'm thinking about one for the near future.
I use some off-brand "third hand" type poles I got for @$19.
Saves a lot of time and tape with visqueen barriers.

Anyone got something really good for carpeted stairs?Put your location in your profile!
(Sorry....it seems there really are dumb questions)Zip-Walls are the only way to go. They are expensive about $600 a piece, but you can get them on e-bay sometimes for cheap. If you have a high-end customer that can get you more work or referralls and want to impress them, zip-walls are the only way to go. Also, if you have subs, make them clean-up everyday.

I have bought this seran wrap type of plastic which sticks to the steps.We use an "air scrubber" that I own from doing mold remediation. Works great to creat positive or negative air pressure, has large flexible hoses to run out of windows, openings, etc. Kinda costly at $1500 but mine has paid for itself many times over. We still need to seal off areas with plastic but if you can control the air movement, you've won the biggest battle.

Also, we always use my nice powerfull triple filtered Hepa Vac, never a plain old shop vac. most shop vacs with dirty used filters vent out alot of small particles which eventually settle. $400-$500 for it but again has paid for itself many times over.

Most customers are impressed when we take the time to control the dust with this simple equipment. Even more impressed when we wear footies over our shoes.

Sunbelt rents this equipment, if you want a quick education check out their catalogue, kinda pricy to rent pricy when they add the new filters, that's why i just bought them. you can buy the "Zipwalls" from them also. Before you put the zipper on the plastic, don't forget to wipe the plastic with an alcohol wipe first so it will stick well.

Good luck,

(Sorry....it seems there really are dumb questions)We use the carpet mask no problem with demo days just replace after demo then after drywall. 

Trask makes the same poles with no plastic parts for 30.00 per pole I picked them up and use them every day and they can also be a third handWe bought our zip wall set and bag from Sherman Williams and they matched the internet price that I found online. It is well worth the money and looks impressive as well.

Ours proved its value when we had to cut in a 2'x2' projection window through a 12" block wall in the projection room of a movie theater. There where 12 movie projectors running along with all of the computers for high definition that go with them. As you can imagine dust was not an option on this one.

The Zip Wall, Rigid air cleaner and a large Shop Vac outside the barrier did the job. We had to cut for 4 minutes and then wait for the dust to clear for another 5 minutes. One of those air scrubbers sure would have been nice but we made due.Jesse Kirchhoff said:

Good idea with the shop vac outside the important zone. you not only vented the vac outside you also created a little negative pressure inside your work area. i've done that when i could to save my hepa filters on large dusty jobs. its all about controlling the air pressure. simple but sometimes not easy.

Ever tried a "grab bag" for a job like you mentioned. Another trick from mold inspections. tape the grab bag to the wall with your tools inside, reach in with the gloves, do the work, seal it back up, close up the grab bag & all done. We used them when inspecting a medical facility once. Everybody was impressed even me.

I just saw my local big orange home improvement center selling a zipwall, i think it was in the plumbing section ???

Tin CupI learned about negative pressure real quick when dust came billowing out of every small nook and cranny at first  Never heard of the grab bag but sounds like a good idea. 

We use a modified 7" grinder with a 12" diamond blade (with custom made blade guard) for masonry wall cutting. That thing gets pretty squirrelly sometimes and hard to hang on to - so it would probably jump out and eat up my grab bag and a few fingers with itAny one ever use this stuff?

Good ideas on creating negative airspace. 

markI went and did an as built field measurement of a house that the county records say was built in 1901. 

In the basement, there are these long concrete bench looking things that appear to be solid concrete around 3/4 of the perimeter of the basement. 
I have asked a couple smart builders that I know what it could be, and the consensus is they might have been poured inside the exterior concrete walls because they used to dump coal down into many of the basements. This concrete would allow for the coal to be poured a few feet deep, and it would not apply too much outward pressure against the foundation walls. 

I have no idea so I'm posting a couple pictures here and hoping that someone out here has run into this before and knows what's going on. 
The homeowner wants to remove that concrete and dig down 18 inches so that he can actually have code compliant headroom and turn it into living space. 

I need to fully understand what these things are and what they do before I let him know if that's possible or not. 
Either way, there will be much engineering involved when you dig out the inside of a basement deeper than the footings.Live NOW…….in the NOWI would think coal would go in a bin. Any signs of foundational wall heaving? These might have been poured as a remedial action.

EDIT: Foundational. Sounds important.“If you need a machine and don't buy it, then you will ultimately find that you have paid for it and don't have it.”
- Henry FordI see this done to stabilize a foundation.

Block walls, as shown in the photos, weren't all that common around here turn of the century.

Could be the whole thing could have been done at basically the same time. Pour the bench over what ever was there, and put block on it.

The funny tail you see on the bench can show up if the cellar was dug out a little deeperDavis I don’t think the walls are block, I think they were formed with boards. The photos make it tough to be sure.“If you need a machine and don't buy it, then you will ultimately find that you have paid for it and don't have it.”

I think you're right.In the midwest those are called Michigan Ledges. I don't think I would tear into those, they look sound though. They were probably installed at one point to lower the floor for more headroom. You can add headroom, but I would dig on the inside of those. Or support the whole house and start over with a new basement.650cc on the track
800cc on the snow 1000cc on the streetI've seen what's called a Michigan wall, that is kind of like what you seem to have. That's where the foundation is only frost depth and then steps in with the bench for a deeper basement.

Yours looks more like the basement wall was kicking in and got reinforced like Davis said. Other option is someone already dug the basement deeper and retrofitted it as a michiganesque wall. (Foundational, indeed, lol)

Either way, to dig out deeper and have functional space, you will probably want to replace the walls altogether. Either that or remove and replace bench for the deeper floor. Don't forget drain height if gravity or you will be using a sump.Haha... Racin beat me.I’ll come underpin it. Say the word and I’ll get my dufflebag.“If you need a machine and don't buy it, then you will ultimately find that you have paid for it and don't have it.”
- Henry FordThe stem walls are poured but the forms look like they used shiplap, like everywhere else (subfloor, wall sheathing), so the concrete looks like layers.
The Ledges appears to be poured after because I saw what I think are small cold joints along the top where the ledge meets the stem wall.

Looks like I will hand this part off to an engineer to further investigate.
If they REALLY want a basement.....someone will figure out what it takes.

I like the idea of jacking the house and replacing with a proper basement....but the budget is not that large.

Thanks for the input. I shall henceforth and forever refer to them as a Michigan ledge wall, even though this is on the outskirts of Seattle.

From Google (Underpinning or Benching) in some cases lowering. Y'all are on it!!Live NOW…….in the NOWYes, most likely that is the case, I ran into this issue a while back was a new "short wall poured" in front of the old deteriorated area of a foundation wall.I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​I believe the term Michigan started when every basement in that state needed that extra support from the short wall.650cc on the track
800cc on the snow 1000cc on the streetI've seen this a few times and agree with the others. I call it bench underpin. 
It's cheaper and easier to do than real underpin. 

Didn't know it was Michigan underpin...Tom

www.gebcon.comI've installed some like you posted above.

Looked at a project that already had these benches installed all around at this big house in Georgetown, DC. They wanted more space and a high headroom garage. 

I explained to the architect that that house had already been effed up, and unless the owner was wanting to tear out all this other stuff, we were not getting involved.Tom

www.gebcon.comFairly common here in older homes that didn't have a full basement here. they where dug out and that type of foundation added.This house originally had some crawlspace and some very low basement. At some point the homeowner wanted more headroom. They dug out the crawlspace and left the perimeter, then poured concrete around it, because they didn't want to under dig the footing.
The lower poured area could have been the coal furnace room and coal storage area. If this house is in an area where coal heat was common. There would be a coal door on the side of the house. The coal would be delivered and shoveled into the basement, through the coal door. It would be held in that room and someone would shovel from that room into the coal furnace. Usually the father, then the older sons as they got old enough. Whichever male drew the short straw.
Pretty common in the midwest.I'd check the chimney to make sure it is lined with metal pipe to the top, it is in good shape, via video inspection.
Here Demo and replace 8' high underpins run up to 1000.00$/ linear foot, depending many factors.
not including floors, and house perimeter items like sidewalks, steps, porches, HVAC, and patios and landscapingI've seen some Michigan ledge walls so cheaply installed that they just added a couple layers of stucco right over the dirt! You could smell the farm-dirt soil as soon as you opened the basement door.650cc on the track

I'm not a contractor, just a guy trying to mount a pulley in his garage. this one to be specific



https://www.lowes.com/pd/National-Hardware-N100-318-V3219-2-in-Wall-Cleaning-Mount-Pulley-in-Zinc-Plated/1002255172



The garage roof is supported by trusses as shown in the image attached and I want to mount the pulleys on the red dots.
I would use (3) 1/4" lags to mount each pulley to the 2x4 joist of the truss. Ideally, I would drill a 9/16" hole directly behind the axle of the pulley to allow wheel removal when installed.
All this is just to add a winch system to hang deer easier, so max weight on the pulley would be about 200 lbs.

Can you guys please tell me:

1. Is mounting the pulleys here ok? (I think probably fine)
2. Is drilling the holes here ok? (I think maybe not)



















Edit: I can place the pulleys in these 2 configurationshttps://www.contractortalk.com/threads/whos-allowed-to-join-contractortalk-com.394977/You know you're old when you can truthfully claim to have spoken with someone born in the 1800's.Don't do it.Thanks for posting on ContractorTalk.com.

Custom Cabinets in Hartford County ConnecticutA common issue we see around here is rot at the base of the back door jamb and sometimes the door itself. When it is just the door jamb that is rotted we can use an oscillating tool to cut off the bottom 6-8" of the jamb leg and replace it with a new treated section of jamb leg. It's not as pretty as replacing the whole side or whole frame but much less expensive for the customer since it only requires removing a small portion of wood and painting one color. 

It seems there should be a similar solution to repairing wood rot on the door itself. Does anyone have experience repairing a door like this instead of buying a whole new door?Your kiddin right?

Who uses band aids on doors anyway, just replace the darn thing and be done.

I can see clearly it wasn't maintained, point in case - thats why its like it is.


It needed paint a few years back, and probably a new seal, now its toast.

Use a bandaid if you want, but imo its like putting lipstick on a pig.

It looks like a inexpensive door but if its worth your time are cut half the bottom rail at least all the rot glue and clamp a new rail with a loose tennon sand paint and add a kickplate.

I might want to address the problem of why it rotted like that to begin with. Must have a water source to make it that way.Grand Rapids Remodeling
Grand Rapids Basement RemodelingTruth is...some doors are inexpensive and you gotta draw a line between the economics of restoration vs. replacement.

Looks like it's a full view door which might have racked a bit and squeezed the jamb and door together - check that door for square and trash if it's out.

Cheap new construction doors...I replace in a heartbeat; Complicated, expensive doors, I'll entertain restoration methods.

The rot only goes an inch or two into the door, so I suspect that we could cut back into the door behind the rot and glue in a small piece. Since the face of the door is steel, I think we could hid the patch so that it is only visible as a line 4-6" up along the end of the door.

This client is a rental property manager so they are not really interested in spending $500-750 to do the job right. Replace the door, jamb, exterior trim, interior trim and 4 colors of paint (int/ext trim/wall). I see this all the time, even with non-rental homes. 

Because this is a managed property they can spend up to $250 before they need to get approval from the actual owner. So I'd like to have a method for repairing this type of door rot for under $250. This way I can give the customer's a choice between a budget job and a brand new front door. Having this repair method allows us to compete with guys who will do the work for nothing.As for the cause...
These are 100k-150k homes that are about 10-15 years old. They used inexpensive materials. There is rarely any eve over the door, if so it's the standard 18" eve that goes around the rest of the house. The rotted doors we see are usually north facing back doors so they don't get any direct sun to dry. Most of the time the concrete patio is poured to within 3" of the threshold so water runs off the roof (no gutters) onto the patio and splashes up the back door. Because the jambs are interior grade pine and the cut ends were probably not primed/painted or set into caulk, water wicks up into the end grain and rots them out. These houses usually have Hardie siding so customers can get away with not repainting the exterior, yea it may look a bit faded but the siding isn't visibly deteriorating due to paint problems, except for this one spot where the builder used untreated wood, outside. PS we also see a lot of untreated 1x4 as window trim in these neighborhoods. These are also rotted on the mitered corners.Are you sure you WANT to compete with those type of guys in the first place???And when the day is done, I can look myself in the mirror, with pride, and say " you're a craftsman, well done. "

I work for management companies also so I understand your price issue. Here it has to be under 300.00. I also understand how the rest of it works when you work for companies like this. Once you touch it you own it. If you half ass it now they will be really happy and tell you how great you are. When in 6-8 months the pice of wood you put in falls out, or the bondo you used to fix the metal cracks they will have you there for free repairing it again. Then they will tell you how you should have fixed it right to start with so now why can't you replace the door like you should have to start with. Oh and they allready paid you once to fix it so the second time is all on you. It's really not worth it to not do it right. Explain it to the Property Manager and have them to get the approval you need to do it right.I need more tools.I would charge more than 250 to go and dink around trying to repair a rotten door anyway. Tell the cheap slumloard the door was originally a POS product and it needs to be replaced. Let him know that you don't like to Jimmy things together because you end up with a shoddy end result and you like to do things right so there are no future recurring problems in the future and in the long run it will save him money. Slumloards love hearing SAVE and MONEY in the same sentence.:laughing:I was typing the same time you were summit. I see we are on the same page with this one:thumbsup:.I think some of you guys poking fun are missing the point. Sure, it's a maintenance issue. So the maintenance wasn't done. I'll share a secret: I get a lot of work from people who didn't do proper maintenance. :thumbsup:

But yes, I'll agree; while there are ways to restore a slab in that condition, in most cases it will cost a significant percentage, or even more than the price of a new one--mostly in labor. A casual reality check usually results in a new slab being ordered.There is one other aspect to this question, my desire to find a repair solution. I don't like waste. 95% of the door is still good. When I replace the door, I'll post the old one for free on craigslist and about half the time it's picked up, I assume to be reused by someone who's less discriminating. The other half of the time it goes to the landfill. The re-hab (used material) store won't take it and I don't know of anyone recycling these around here.Did you try scraping, Bondo, sand, then paint?I haven't tried anything yet and probably won't for this customer since I bid it my normal rate for complete replacement. I'm a bit surprised that nobody else is thinking along the repair lines.So our garage has a storage space that I want to remove because I cannot fit two cars in the garage. I have removed the dry wall but wanted to get an opinion on if the wall is load bearing or not. It's built on top of a finished ceiling so you can't see the joists. It's just a 2x4 framing the wall.

Greensboro, NCyeah, so it's probably NOT load bearing, because IRC R350.69 states all studs in load bearing walls shall bear the words LOAD BEARING stamped on one of the 3 ½" sides and one of the 1 ½" sides. Good framers will make sure that the stamped side is visible for inspection. I don't see the stamps on any of the studs in your pix.

The whole idea of the stamped studs was to make it easier to ID bearing walls, so people didn't have to actually go into an attic or use some over means to know what the joists + rafters or trusses are doing up there.Live NOW…….in the NOWA real estate agent friend asked me to look at one of her clients houses today. This one was a rental, and the occupant left her dog alone for long periods of time. The lady moved out yesterday, so we went over this morning to check the place out.

The family room carpet stink is almost overwhelming and is still wet in areas where the dog had been doing it's business. I peeled back a few areas of the rug and can see that the plywood subfloor is wet also. We checked out the mud room and found areas with the same problem although it's on a slab. 

Do you guys know of any treatment that I can use after the sub floors dry out to kill any remaining odor?

Thx....... JohnDouble post...http://www.natural-dog-health-remedies.com/dog-urine-cleaning.html#sthash.FJyYJOU8.dpufWhy Does Dog Urine Smell?

Dog urine is a made up of ammonia, nitrogen, uric acid, bacteria, and hormones. 
Uric acid contains crystals that are left behind even after the urine has dried. 
When there is moisture in the air due to, say, high humidity, these crystals are reactivated and that's why we can smell dog urine even long after we think we have cleaned it up. 

Here is an easy way to completely clean dog urine and remove the smell: 
Using paper towels or a rag, absorb as much of the urine as possible.
Pour water over the area, and dry it again using paper towels - Stop only when the towels are not soaking up yellowish stains.
Spray or pour a natural cleaner over the area and let it "sit" for a while (depending on the cleaner you use - see below). 
Dry the area thoroughly.


Natural Dog Urine Cleaners

White Vinegar

White Vinegar is a good and effective natural dog urine cleaner. After finishing Steps 1 and 2 described above, soak the area completely with undiluted white vinegar. 
Let it soak in well and sit for several minutes before blotting the area dry. 

Baking Soda

Baking soda is effective in absorbing odor. After finishing Steps 1 and 2 described above, pour enough baking soda to cover the affected area and let it sit for a few hours before vacuuming. 

Hydrogen Peroxide

Add one part hydrogen peroxide to two parts water. After finishing Steps 1 and 2 described above, pour the mixture on the area and let it sit for 5-10 minutes before blotting the area dry.Stoney has some new ideas for me... gotta try them...

Otherwise, I've just used the old standards.... whack it with Natures Miracle (pet store) for a few days and cover with a heavy coat of Shellac.Never stop learning (xcep fer speling en typeing):stupid:Replace the subfloor.

A friend of mine owns a carpet store and he sells a product called "UrineOut" and I bought some when I was replacing some flooring for someone. I works VERY WELL and permentaly removes the smell. It won't, however repair the rot of plywood or the swelling of MDF or particle board, so you still have that to contend with.

I'll have to try that, it looks good. I've always done the baking soda/peroxide thing with decent results. I've tried the UrineOut before, but it didn't work for my needs. It's geared toward carpet and pad. Most times I'm tearing out the funky carpet and installing a hard surface floor. 

I Had a job a few years ago where the dogs had been pissing on the baseboards in a bedroom for so long I had to tear out rotten BB's, casings, insulation, and rock in the room. Even the insul was soaked. Was F-in DISGUSTING. Got some kind of spray from a pet store (I don't remember the name) that was high-dollar and it didn't really work all that good. Even after spraying everything in sight with oil primer, it still stunk. Smelled like a dog pissed in a paint can :laughing:A couple years back, I looked at an "interesting" prep-for-sale job in a nice neighborhood. From the outside, nice, big house, clean, well-kept. Two professionals lived there...and their fifteen rescue dogs. The dogs no longer were let outside since the neighbors kept complaining about the noise. I couldn't believe my eyes.

As we walk the job, the owners acted like it was normal. They were seeking affordable solutions for the damaged hardwood and inexpensive ways to "freshen-up" the kitchen base cabinets (urine damage) to put it on the market. I declined. They ended up using a flooring guy to refinish most of the flooring - not replace. I got called over there 6 months later for some reason, and went just to see what finally happened. I could still smell it. I don't know how the new family could stand it, and they had a baby, too. Very sad situation.dog urine smell removal

I had the same issue after purchasing a rental to renovate. There was a distinct urine smell and huge stain on the wood sub floor after the carpet was removed. 
I saturated the wet area with a bleach solution as it basically kills all bacteria and viruses. I treated the area twice and the smell was gone. I then used Kilz to seal it up before having new carpet installed. 
Easy and cheap way to solve the problem.Went back over to this house again today and pulled out all the carpet and padding. The plywood subfloor had 2 large areas of total saturation from the urine. It even smelled bad in the crawlspace. This dog must have had a bladder the size of a olympic pool. My agent friend was there to take pictures of the damages, and she was texting them to the owner who lives in Ohio as we went along. I will be cutting out about 60 S.F. of subfloor. Now they want me to refinish 828 S.F. of the original hardwood floor, repair & treat 603 S.F. of the carpeted subfloors. Skim out 2 bathrooms that had been previously tiled and repaint. Repair some serious cracking issues with the plaster ceilings throughout, and repaint all affected ceilings. 

Working with real estate agents can be a PITA some times, but they keep me swamped with some pretty interesting jobs. I felt a little guilty when I told my flooring contractor friend that I will be bailing out on him next week for about 12 days to "knock this one out", but he was all for it.

Thanks for all the tips on the urine problem guys. I will be sorting through the info for a couple days to come up with a plan.

 Was the subfloor dry before the shellac?There is a difference between masking a smell and removing a smell.
Many things will mask the smell but the duration is limited. Some last longer than others but ultimately the smell will return unless you replace the infected products.
The two things I find you can't really eliminate completely, pet odors and fire odors.

Ask them to give you the names of 3-4 local subs who work for them, then call those subs and see how they like it. You can also do a couple of jobs for them and see how it goes.That's a good idea, but I'm worried they would just give me the names of local subcontractors that they have good relationships with and would only offer a positive view of the company. If there's anyone on this forum who has experience working with them, I know it's not coming through the company.I just looked them up. They are in my area as well, although I've never heard of them until now. You might want to look up their customer reviews for your area on Yelp or similar. In my area they have many lengthy reviews that contain useful hints on how they operate.It's really a nice question, and the subcontractors have worked there and have good experience of it, and they have learned so many new things.Do we really need the bot posting inane mumbling's? The mumbling's are my job and that makes the bot superfluous.Hey, man. I’ve heard of them. I was in search of a company that would remodel my house. According to the reviews, it’s not the best company to work as a contractor for. Personally, I didn’t work for them. That’s what the reviews tell. Btw, eventually, I hired this company https://www.homeremodelinglafayettela.com/. My brother has recently been hired by them. Anyway, I’m not sure what their current situation is. Maybe they’ve improved their service, maybe not. The company I hired is a good one. I like the redesign they’ve made for us. So, the choice is up to you.AbiGayle, huh?

You are correct. Faucet hole is on left corner, as was the previous one. Drawing two perpendicular lines to the hole, faucet hole is centered inside the lines.

- Henry FordBeen removing the chimney in stages for the last few weeks. Had the top portion removed when we did the roof, then removed the middle stack in the attic in about a day. Now I’m working on the bottom part which is on the ground floor. 

Everything is going well, but I encountered some framing and I just want to verify it’s not structural to the house. My intention is to remove the framing that lies at the front of the chimney breast, and of course leave alone the framing behind the chimney (that framing is the main load-bearing wall of the house, supporting the ceiling joists at the middle).

Basically looking at a chimney breast that is supporting 2x4’s, which go up and attach to the area that was boxed around the chimney. The walls has plaster and lath and the lath were secured to this framing.
The leftmost and rightmost members are each nailed into a ceiling joist from the side, but not providing any support for the joist from below. I presume the joists are providing support to the framing here, not Vice versus.

The middle members are supporting a box that went around the chimney - two 2x6x24” pieces of lumber that are supported by the main load bearing wall on one side, and by this framing on the other side. I was considering using joist hangers to support the side of the boxing that would be left unsupported if I removed the framing in question.

I can pick up lath location using a halogen work light and my thermal imager. Start warming the wall with the work light, then check with the thermal imager to see where the lath is. You should be able to tell where you have busted keys as well.

If you heat too long, you may not be able to see , so you let it cool off and check as it is cooling.

Yes, I was thinking FLIR, but did not think of the heat source to produce the gradient (!) Thanks. Problem solved.Going to get either FLIR, Klein, or Uni-T - probably an Android phone attachment - little Klein handheld is only standalone barely being considered. Although the FLIR One Pro is top performance, internal battery is a big negative - battery goes bad on $400 unit, what? Throw away? 

Going to see what IR threads are here.I had the Flir one a few years ago and had lots of issues with it and sent it back for repairs 3 times, never fixed and ran out of warranty which was short during this time and the were no help. Battery dies super fast.rrk said:

You are not alone - a number of people have had the same problem.

I've called FLIR 3 times asking about products and every time I spoke to foreigners with marginal English and twice they had to take time to find out answers to my basic questions - like they were consulting or using internet to get info.

That is an awesome technique/ trick. Will have to remember that.I think the following would also work IF the plaster was unpainted:

Mist just enough water to put a sheen on the plaster, then watch it dry/evaporate - I'm pretty sure you'll see the lath boards (I think I saw this phenom when repairing some walls.) I believe the scratch coat will absorb water like sponge while the lath wood would be a barrier - so the lath gaps would dry first.

Hummmm.... I have a TIFF temp meter that has a number of attachments, one is a fancy contact thermocouple (another one is a TC in a short tube for air temp flowing in tube - either atmospheric or from a connected hose.) Could do a series of point measurements and see if the pattern reveals itself (unfortunately, it is not a smooth surface, a light relief skip-trowel finish.)The only thing I've noticed on a very wet wall, the key area stays wet longer.MrCreosote said:

For phones I'm thinking Klein or Uni-T. But that $400 Uni-T hand held is tempting. I figure I'm going to get a basic $200 model and start using it. I think the K is $250 and the UT is $190. Both have higher max temps than the basic FLIRs. The software package is probably the deciding factor but how can one compare them?I picked up one of the Flir phone adapters a year and a half/ two years ago. 

I haven't had any issues with it, the only issue I have (and it's not the fault of the adapter) is my otterbox case is too thick to use with it, so I have to pull that back. I switched to using it with my tablet, no issues with the case and a much larger screen to look at

My build is such that there will be no drywall or over the cmu wall. The cmu wall containing the recessesed outlet or switch will be customer facing. If the opening is not made properly it would be unsightly. I was thinking precast would lower the margin of error there. But if you are telling me that this is a relatively routine matter and it is easy to do then then it is moot. Is it possible to place the brick and make the opening for the utilities before the rest of the wall is built on top of it? Or does the wall need to be built then the holes made? If it was planned properly could the hole be made in a block before it is set?Yes. Talk to your mason and your electrician.Owen Yo said:

To qualify a construction company in Florida, you must be licensed by Florida and have either a 20% stake in the company or be a W2 employee.
So in your case, you would probably end up hiring a contractor as a W2 employee which means you will also be paying the vig of having W2 employees (matching withholdings and workers comp).
You can avoid the withholding match and workers comp if you make them a 20% owner.
If you want to completely transfer liability you would also need to hire them as the FRO for the company, which will cost you more in salary. If not, you will assume financial responsibility for the business and adherence to all of Florida's financial laws.

I would NOT recommend a qualifier take on the FRO role, which increases their risk exponentially. One of the top reasons Florida license contractors loses their license is when the company you have qualified (or their own company) take money from their customers and do not do the work or start a job and abandon it.

Also, if the person you are qualifying is serving as an FRO, they have to pass a background check, have a minimum FICO score (credit credit of the business and FRO) and post a bond. I think the minimum FICO score requirement was recently relaxed, where you only need to take a 14-hour course if the score is less than 660.1982_Everton said:

With or without the FRO designation, you still need to pass a background check and the credit score requirement (which is so low any reasonable contractor would easily meet it without having to take the course). The FRO designation requires no extra paperwork or qualifications, it's just a checkbox on the form.
Yes FRO elevates the risk factor hence the reason it would cost more in salary. Any competent contractor can ensure proper client and sub money flow since as FRO they have access to the funds and the books. I would prefer to be the FRO instead of not being if the situation allowed. You have more control to ensure things are done properly and the authority to enforce proper fiscal management.95% 96% 97% of the people around me would fail an open book test.

DBPR CILB 8 - Financially Responsible Officer

The FRO, who is NOT the qualifying contractor, has to submit a CLIB-8 application, so it's not just checking a box. I have qualified two companies and have never assumed the FRO role, so I'm not sure how the background/credit check works outside that domain. The question is: If the qualifying contractor is also the FRO, how does the company owner's name, enter into the application process for DBPR to require a background/credit check for the owner?

The application for qualifying a company is filled out by the contractor. 
If they are going to be the FRO, YOU JUST CHECK THE BOX designating it. So it is absolutely just checking a box. 
There are no "extra" requirements when you check the box. As the contractor, you have the exact same application requirements if you are FRO or if you are not. Because, as I said, the things required of the FRO are already required of the qualifying contractor.

If the qualifier checks the box and becomes FRO, the Owner(s) are NOT required to have background checks or credit checks.
The only requirement is a commercial credit check of the COMPANY itself.95% 96% 97% of the people around me would fail an open book test.

poultry staples, which to me were a pain to get in, I also switched to screws or drywall nails.Installed the bulk of the L channel today (leaving a separate room for later), using 1/4 x 1 1/4 crown staples.

Base cabs first, bottle jack on top of base cabs. Works okay with two people.

www.fiber-tech.netHi
This may be a silly question but I thought I would ask. I have been asked to install a new bath, replacing a cast iron bath. The client wants a good sturdy bath and has asked me to recommend a bath make and should it be steel or acrylic. I have only ever fitted acrylic baths so would like anyones advice.
Any recommendations anyone
1. Steel or acrylic
2. Bath manufacturer
thanksDon't know what you mean by sturdy. Nothing is going to feel like cast iron, certainly not acrylic, Heavy steel maybe most tubs I do anymore are free standing.We try and have original cast iron tubs refinished if possible. It's way cheaper and if the original tub is in decent condition, they get a better product.

Just had an original 1940's art deco style tub done for a client and it looks better than new. It was like 700 bucks to have done. Plus if it isn't getting a whole bath remodel, no demo or retile, etc. 

Most new tubs of the standard variety suck.Cast iron here.durabke and quiet. Sucks for the second floor but steel chips and acrylic scuffs/dulls.Steel can creak and squeek. Even the ones with a foam base attached.I always installed cast-iron tubs for every job, but for the past 20+ years I am finding that the glaze is no longer any good on even the most-expensive tubs. The manufacturers are claiming the inferior glaze is due to their inability to use lead. So, even brand new tubs have a finish where you can see the black cast-iron through the glaze and cast-iron tubs are in bad condition in about 20 years.

Pressed steel chips too easily and I've had many get chipped before new bathrooms were completed. The worst thing about pressed steel is the tubs rust and get holes through them.

For the past 40+ years almost every new construction home, motel and hotels have been using plastic tub and showers and that it what I started using a few years ago. You both the walls and tub for less than $1,000 and you don't need to pay $2500+ for tile or imitation granite walls. One downside to plastic or fiberglass is some idiots put burning cigarettes on them, but that is actually rare. If plastic or fiberglass needs to be replaced they can be cut out with a sawzall in a few minutes and replaced in one day with minimal damage to the drywall and floor. I always order the plastic walls with the tile design and 4 soap dishes. The plastic tubs are much easier to clean and rarely get moldy."If you have a horn, don't be afraid to toot it"Fiberglass tubs structurally hold up well, but a scratch in an acrylic tub bottom will lead to a crack, so they have to be inspected and recoated if they're scratched.Most bathrooms i do go with an Americast tub, i haven't had any issues with them yet

She spilled something hot on a door and the thermofoil bubbled. I have tried a heat gun to smooth/reglue it, did not work, made it worse. Any suggestions.

No manufacturers name anywhere that I can find, so replacing the doors does not seem to be an option, can't match others.

JB Wilmington, DEI would just start calling manufacturers of thermofoil cabinets and ask if they can find you a replacement, armstrong.com is one. Another thing you can try is an auto body supply store, they sell paint and repair kits for vinyl/PVC which might work.Just Google it there are all kinds of place that can make them for you LinkJust Bill said:

When a thermofoil door has bubbled or is peeling around edges, there is nothing that I am aware of that can remedy this. When such has happened to me, I order a new door (lots of manufacturers). Depending upon the color and age of existing doors/drawer fronts, you may have to get multiples in order to match. 

I've had good results using Premoule out of Canada, and Cabinet Restylers (a division of Thiels's Replacement Sytems) based in Ohio. But I'm sure there are plenty of other good companies out there to choose from.

We apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused. This thread has been closed.We are getting our 2nd story bathroom updated. When the old floor tile was taken up we found a leak from the toilet which damaged the plywood and called for part of ceiling downstairs to have to be cut out due to mold/rot. Supposedly the toilet was not set right on seal which caused the slow leak. 
My concern is, the foor guy put the new plywood around the toilet flange with the seam of two pieces of plywood right up the centerline of the flange (where the toilet will sit) instead of using one piece of plywood with a hole cut out for the flange.That area with the seam doesn’t feel strong. If i step on both sides of it it rocks. Cement board will go on top and then tile but should the plywood have been installed differently? There is not much support around the flange underneath the plywood just to note. There is just a piece of wood behind the flange under the floor.
Also, should the flange be above the plywood more than what it is to make room for cement board and tile?Contracortalk is for Contractors only.

I plan to keep the toilet but change the seat and tank. I also plan to keep the tub. I will preserve the walls as much as possible but everything else goes. New vanity, counters, counter tops, faucets, floor tile, light fixtures, medecine cabinets, and if my budget allows I will buy new appliances.

I wouldnt say it's a full remodel because I am keeping a few things, but it's definetly more than a face lift. But hell it's a condo and I will be renting this place out to someone within a few years as I live in my marbel walled mansion on my private island. <dreams>-Grumpy

I thought about granite, but it's a condo. Why bother with the expense? I went to a bar the other week that had a custom counter top. It was marbel tile adhesived to some kind of 2" wood counter underneath. I was thinking of giving that a shot because it looks great if done right and it about half the cost of a granite top of equal size. 

A few buds of mine suggested Corian also. Bathroom will be ceramic but kitchen will be some kind of premium vinyl or I was thinking about maybe pergo for the kitchen since the rest of my condo is all hard wood oak.-Grumpy
Chicago Gutters Chicago RoofingLaminate flooring is a good choice. THere is a granite called Bennissimo that has a rounded bullnose edge, that costs less than corian. Although I like corian quite a bit.------------------------

Chicago Gutters Chicago Roofingremodeling the bathroom,sure sounds fun. i would definily replace the bathtub.. we have a pretty large one an a small one but no matter what size they are they are not as comfy as a german bathtub. you just cant lay down...
are you going to put tiles all over the walls ?flor; carpet or tiles? i would go for tiles on everything, especialy if you will someday rent it out a tile is easier replaced than carpet, plus kids love splashing... i am no `pro` in this, just my oppinion...
stainless steel for the kitchen? no fun to clean but looks niceFor monetary reasons I am keeping the bathtub and toilet. Everything else is being replaced. I sit down in my tub just about every day, can't lay but I can sit  

Not sure where I am putting tile yet. I think JUST in the shower area which will have a nice classy sliding shower door installed to seperate the regular space from the tub space. 

No way in HE!! I am going to put carpet in the bathroom or kitchen. In my opinion that looks t a c k y. I am definetly going to tear out the old floor tile and put a new floor tile. 

I'm thinking of brushed nickel hardware for the bathroom, not sure on the kitchen stuff yet. I havent given that too much thought since that is PHASE II.

Once I am using it as a tub, what should I clean it with? Can it be painted and if so will regular metal primer and paint be the best to use?
I love this tub because I can emmerse my entire body in it and because of its narrow size it doesn't use as much water. Any feedback about this type of tub would be appreciated. Thanks.Hi all!

Ok thanks!Restaining is not something I would take on, but here are my random thoughts, anyway...

Sanding?? Why not strip.... or clean and paint... or replace all the doors, etc? You have to really have a passion for this, because there's easier work to be had.. every day.I think you should have someone more knowledgeable do the job.I always pitch new doors, then finish however they want. Margins are better. 
Except for cabinets with glass doors, I've rarely done the insides. 
These are questions you have to ask them and put into the scope. The last thing you want to hear when done is "I thought you were going to..."Never do the insides, usually strip the doors, just let them know beforehand. I had a customer ask about the tops and bottoms alreadyI do the inside of the doors and frames, but not inside the cabinet itself. I have had good results restaining cabinets. Be sure you are clear about what the customer is expecting, could be anything from a freshen up to a color change.The only time I would sand a cabinet is to rough them up for better glue adhesion for the refacing material.
I know it can be done correctly with time and experience. 
No matter what you do and before you do any work, it should be spelled out, in writing, EXACTLY what you are going to do and NOT do.
Including any disclaimers about what could go wrong such as uneven results in certain areas, blotching, etc...95% 96% 97% of the people around me would fail an open book test.
Everybody wants to live in interesting times, until things get interesting.Once you explain that every single thing must be removed from the cabinets and stored out of the way, the interior is not so much of an option.Tom

www.gebcon.comIf she wants to go darker just clean/scuff sand and gel stain them or even use a toner to darken the shade with the poly on top will bring life to them but if she wants to go lighter I would sell her hard on painting them because the veneer that is usually on the sides of cabinets you know that smooth fake wood with fake grains doesn't really take stain otherwise strip sand and be there for a month and with gas prices it would end up being charity work.

Well the restaining is what they requested specifically. And we stripped and sanded, wasn’t too crazy. I just wanted to know how much I should do to consider the job done well. Unfortunately, this customer is way too easy going and when I ask a question I get “whatever is easiest for you guys”.

Tried the selling on paint, that she wasn’t budging on. I enjoy the process of staining so it’s not too bad. And her cabinets are legitimate wood, they’re just older. They held up well actually, so she didn’t want to get rid of them, just breathe some life into it.Joe Fairplay said:

Good luck!"We'll be fine"Hi all,
I am sick and tired of silicone caulking, its a pain in the ass to remove - nearly impossible to get rid of once its time is up.

What caulking do you guys use that is not only good, but easy to remove when necessary? (i.e remove the caulking every 3 years and reset new caulking)What application are we talking about here? They make temporary caulking for sealing drafty windows and stuff during the winter months that can be peeled off in the spring but that’s a lot different than any application I would use silicone for. Proper caulking selection and application technique seems like it would be the remedy for a 3 year failure cycle.I have silicone on my 70's shower door that still works. Why would you need to redo it?

Sent from my SM-N950U using TapatalkJust use caulk remover.Personally, I love Dynaflex 230. Like you, I hate silicone caulk, and refuse to use it.

Sent from my SM-G530T using TapatalkAlso started using Dynaflex 230. 

I found the silicone not adhering to aluminum coil stock and/or vinyl windows. At first it looks great. A year or two later, it has come loose from one or the other and can be peeled off by hand.

What situation are you removing caulking only to re-apply it, every 3 years?The majority of individuals, on the other hand, prefer to use latex (or acrylic) caulking. Latex is water-soluble, making it simple to use and clean up afterward.worldknown said:

At least he didn’t have a link to an angies list caulking contractor.I recommend making different size beads of caulk maybe 100ft long each on wax paper let them dry then just shove it in the crack.That won’t work.

Do I have to teach you everything?I need to replace siding on my home. Due to the economy and cash flow being short. I’m thinking of doing it myself. However, what do I do in regards to siding located behind the electric service. Do I need to have the power company temporarily remove the service or is there another way of removing the siding without removing the service.What kind of siding is there now. Sure makes it a pain with the mast run like that. With a wood or Masonite type of siding I have just cut the siding up tight to the box when removing then side back up tight to it and caulk. It will more then likely require a permit to disconnect pull the box and reconnect which could be a real pain.What kind of siding is there now/QUOTE]

Click to expand...Some of the siding is rotted outI would cut the siding from around it and then trim, flash and caulk it really well. then just side around it. 

The conduit will be a pain, but you just need to work the siding behind the conduit the best you can.You can wiggle out that old siding if you make a few cuts nearby. I would make a pvc panel that matches the profile of the box, the split it at the conduit. Properly flash the top, and your good to go.I call my utility company and they pull the globe and the screws and come back when I'm done. No charge.

Save the straps as you go so it's not stressing the conduitHopefully the cedar isnt stud nailed over gypsum sheathing.Tom M said:

That by far would be the best if they will do it where he is at. That way can get at the lags holding the box down.What type of siding do you have now? With the mast run like that, it's a real hassle. When removing the siding from a wood or Masonite box, I just chop it up tight to the box and seal it. Disconnecting and reconnecting the box will very certainly require a permit, which may be a major nuisance.Hi guys a quick one,

Eventually I would like to work in new homes, has anyone here moved from remodels into new home supervisor/foreman roles before? If so how did you do it?

Thanks 


Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkMelbourne. Aus, based carpenter/renovator.Grew up in the family home building business, shifted some towards remodeling when the Great Housing Crash occurred. Doing some small repairs and remodels, but trying to stay focused on new builds and additions. 

Remodeling is more of a service, as you are working in their home. New construction is more of a product. You will end up working with trades who are good with new construction, but you might not want to send them in someones home. Likewise a guy running crown molding in a new home with no furniture and flooring needs to knock the room out quickly. In remodeling the goal is to get it up without damaging the existing walls, paint, furniture etc. 

Hope this helps.Agreed. it's a pain.... I prefer retail building. Condos are the worst!I just made a very similar post wondering the same thing.I do interior demo, mostly on old buildings. I am also trying to get into more new construction demo.“If you need a machine and don't buy it, then you will ultimately find that you have paid for it and don't have it.”

There is a full finished basement. So access is no problem. Also wants basement ceiling higher. I'll have to demo ceiling anyway. 

I have cut port holes in a few spots in the basement ceiling found all pipe and wiring.

Hopefully you can disconnect the existing and route the supply, return to the new install. Not sure I’d put insulation under it.

Check with the flooring manufacture to make sure it can go over heat. 

This is one I’d recommend finding a qualified radiant heat installer in your area.

It looks like they are faux muntins that are over a full piece of glass?

Without seeing how they are installed:

One option is the muntins/grills are just pinned in with brads and can be removed and carefully peeled off the glass.

Or you may be able to declare the window from the inside and paint grid and replace window.

Hard to tell with only a closeup to look at.

Could you paint a grid on the inside of the glass? Bit of a crap solution though.IMO, the only decent solutiin is to pull the mullions, clean it all up, paint, put back in.I'm an Oregon homeowner who needs repairs to the soffit + rake trim on the front, a section of loose vinyl paneling on one side, and a hole given to chronic birds-nesting, and all these repairs are near the roof's edge (30-35 ft high).

I'm afraid to hire a contractor who doesn't have insurance for working at these heights (whether that be workers comp, disability, or whatever), even if they're licensed and bonded, because I don't want to risk being held responsible for their medical expenses in case of a fall (there's nothing specific to my house that I'm concerned about, like rot or shoddy construction, and my house is not yet 20 years old).

The problem, however, is that I've lost count of the number of general contractors, gutter companies, and roofing companies that I've called who've turned down the job because it's too small for them. The only estimator that one company sent out said outright he didn't want the job but would do it for $10,000 (of course, he never bothered to write up an actual estimate).

What am I supposed to do in this dilemma? Are my only options to 1) just give the job to someone without insurance, and pray that they don't fall off their ladder and bankrupt me with their medical expenses, or 2) hire a company to unnecessarily redo the whole siding of my house just so that I can bloat the job enough to be worth their time?

PS, I've also looked into renting a boom lift for a licensed but uninsured contractor/handyman to use to safely do the repairs, but then that introduces the risk of accidental damages to neighboring houses/cars. Although, since that should be covered by their liability insurance or surety bond (right?), would that still be the best option that I'm left with in the end?

Say you are in a remodel where theres a partial tear out and after the demo you find something that was not predicted in your bid... for example a previous bad remodel 30 years back left coverd up or horrid mold issue, or buried gas lines where they shouldn't be (could be just about anything that isn't a cheap,fast&SLeasy way to just fix it)

Does this then require a new adendum to the contract...

and should there be a clause written in the original contract for these unforseen challanges ?

Absolutely right :thumbsup:

If you feel that there may be issues, prepare the customer (aka - drive it into their brain very clearly, and repeatedly). Also, include it in your proposal and your contract wording for that particular job. Add it into the specific wording of the job, and, as stated, always have it as a clause in all your contracts.

Example: 

CONCEALED/ HIDDEN ISSUES: Standard Exclusions; Additional charges above and beyond the original estimate may be incurred in the event of discovered structural or design issues. Such issues may be the result of previous poor workmanship, faulty installation, faulty materials, failed framing members, any matter requiring changes to a work surface, etc. All costs associated with correcting existing out-of-plum, out of level, out-of-aligned conditions, or improper/poor work, in an existing structure would result in additional charges. This policy also covers any existing plumbing or electrical issues that are not listed for replacement, alteration, upgrade, or repair in the original scope-of-work. This would include the re-routing of vents, pipes, ducts, structural members, wiring, conduits, or steel mesh that may be discovered in the removal of walls or the cutting of openings in walls or ceilings. In such an event, work will cease and additional charges will be determined in order to perform the required work. 
XXXX Construction Services, Inc - would not be held liable for any delays caused by work procedure changes due to matters listed in this exclusion addendum. In the event of one of the afore mentioned delays, we reserve the right to relocate to another work project until the stated matter(s) are rectified, determined, or an "aggremeement to proceed", is made.

EXISTING WATER DAMAGE OR PEST DAMAGE: Standard Exclusions; Hidden and unforeseen damage may be found during construction, installation or repair phases of a contracted job. Additional charges above and beyond the original estimate may be incurred in the event of discovered water damage and/or pest damage. This would include the correcting/testing/remediation of mold/fungus/mildew and organic pathogens, unless such is caused by the sole and active negligence of the contractor and is a direct result of construction defect that caused sudden and significant water infiltration into a part of the structure. This involves all interior/exterior parts, and materials directly connected to and affected by said damage. In such an event, work will cease. Additional charges will be determined in order to perform the necessary required repair work. The Customer may decide to continue or discontinue additional work at such time. XXXX Construction Services would not be liable for any delays caused by the matters listed in this exclusion addendum/clause. In the event of one of the afore mentioned delays, we reserve the right to relocate to another work project until the stated matter(s) are rectified. 

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS: Standard Exclusions; Defined as Lead, asbestos, mold spores, toxins, dangerous chemicals and their vapors, and all other materials categorized as “Hazardous Waste” by the EPA, as being dangerous to the environment and/or health of living organisms. Client is responsible to notify this contractor of any known hazardous materials existing in their structure, property or other locations of the contracted worksite, and it’s adjoining areas prior to the contract agreement being finalized. In the event of discovered Hazardous Materials that require abatement or handling of any kind, work will cease. Additional charges required to retain a licensed and state approved company to conduct the removal and disposal process will be evaluated. This would include, but not be limited to, scheduling, testing, inspections, transportation & disposal, legal documentation, filing fees, decontamination, clean up, and all other related charges. All costs related to the inspection, evaluation and required abatement work are the responsibility of the Client. XXXX Construction Services would not be responsible for any delays caused by such discovered issues. In the event that one of the afore mentioned issues were to cause a delay, we reserve the right to relocate to another work project until the stated matter(s) are rectified. 

Now, I am not saying that any one of these examples are what a person or company can put into their contracts and be legally covered for, in their state, or their specific situations. 
I am showing these as examples of points/clauses, that you may need to include. Obviously, wording is about legality, and all contracts should be reviewed by an actual lawyer, before being put into use by a contractor.- Build Well -Craft-man said:

Now I guess the next Question: Is there a generic contract I can get a hold of to use as my contract? or do I need to make an appointment with a lawyer (any lawyer of a specialized one for construction?) and have them make a new contract just for my company ? Or is there a standard Remodeling contract that can be retrieved somewhere?There are many contracts available with copy/paste clauses or fill in the blanks. There is a lot to be said for making absolutely sure it will be legal and binding in your local.

I went to my attorney and requested a contract that met all state and local requirements, balanced and to be written in plain language that I could explain. After his first document I asked for a couple more clauses that I just thought would make it better, he agreed and amended. 

I visit to his office, the rest on the phone and fax. Total cost $150.

WTF thread is 14 years old this site is for professional contractors visit DIY Home Improvement ForumIf you know anyone who has done home remodeling before, please get a hold of me.Sure thing.What trades are you looking for?

I may know a few people and/or businesses.

Andy.https://andytardif.wixsite.com/websitePlease contact me if you know how to do home remodeling projects.I do remodeling, as do many of our members. Obviously, since this site is for contractors.

Are you a contractor? Why are you looking for remodelers?I know I'm cruising for a bruising here. I can't find my RRP book and this is a weird situation anyhow.

I need to tear off the old clapboards in a couple alleys in a populous area. I'm going over to measure tomorrow and grab some pics but I think the alleys are perhaps three or five feet wide. Adjacent buildings are owned by other parties. At first I was thinking, no problem, plastic on the ground and maybe hang plastic to bookend the alley on the street side (private alley) to reduce wind and peeping Toms. This plan doesn't really address the fact that the neighbors have windows in the alley and it'll probably be July when I do the work. They might have the windows open. Might not.

Anyway, if I can't cover the ground ten feet back, because there's a building there, do I need to go vertical? Anybody done something like this?“If you need a machine and don't buy it, then you will ultimately find that you have paid for it and don't have it.”
- Henry FordYes are suppose to do vertical to contain any dust also people need to be notified that you are doing it too.

Fair point. I won't bring it up because I get paid to remove things. The more the merrier.“If you need a machine and don't buy it, then you will ultimately find that you have paid for it and don't have it.”
- Henry FordSo what's the play, pump jacks for doing the work, and a pair of braced and strong-backed 2x8s, one on each end of the alley, lagged to the sheathing, supporting a rope on the cantilevered ends, pulled tight between the two 2x8s, from which I hang weighted plastic down to the ground?

Sounds cheesy as hell. I just made that plan in thirty seconds so I'm imaging someone's got a better idea.“If you need a machine and don't buy it, then you will ultimately find that you have paid for it and don't have it.”
- Henry FordYou will need to go vertical if neighboring property is within 10'. I have strung ropes between trees and draped plastic sheeting over it, clamp in place and weighs on the ground. I have also used roll around scaffolding to build towers and then clamp plastic sheeting between towers to make a vertical barrier that is moveable. 
Nothing says the barrier has to be at the 10' mark so plastic around the pump jacks would work too.I'd hang plastic from the pumpjacks. Maybe put outriggers on it to keep it away from the workspace a foot or so. You also need to go higher than the work area IIRC.

Especially if there are neighboring windows.

All for removing siding that won't make hardly a bit of dust and the flakes will fall straight down. As will the dust, because lead is heavy.

Are you sure it's lead? Check everywhere. Might just be trim or might just be one spot. I saw a job once where only one piece of trim had lead on the entire house.

Sent from my SM-N975U using TapatalkHi All,

My wife and I bought this mixed use building in Bethlehem, NH that was built in 1877. It's retail space on the 1st floor and a 3 bedroom apartment on the 2nd floor. The apartment is in good shape so we are leaving that alone for now. We are in the process of interior demo on the 1st floor and basement to reveal the structure and see what needs to be repaired.

The good news is there doesn't appear to be much rot so far. You can see all the water staining but it's dry and in good shape. My initial plan was to spray foam all the exterior walls to air seal but now I realize there probably isn't a vapor barrier barrier on the other side of sheathing between the clapboards. (You can see the exterior through the window in the picture below)

Do I need to remove all the clapboards, Tyvek wrap, and then reside the building? We are doing all new windows, doors, etc. I want it to be "tight" so it doesn't cost a million dollars to heat when it's -22 out. Can we just spray foam directly into the walls? I worry the sheathing won't be able to dry when it gets wet and will rot without some kind of barrier? 

We plan to keep this place long term and will both live and run a retail store out of the space.

I arranged for labor help on this one, and I have to keep checking that they're avaiable as the days slip away. I set it up, get the can dropped, run for materials and finish goods, assemble the cabs (rta), etc.and everything else. 

We seemed to have settled on the main decisions, but then I started getting "what about this?" Questions at the 11th hour. "What are they made of?" What other options are there?" "What about the grey?" This thing was supposed to be (another) White Shaker from the beginning.Well what are you doing? Swapping out cabinets?

Custom Cabinets in Hartford County ConnecticutI am starting a moderate kitchen tomorrow for a family member. I told her to plan on 2 months. Cabinets are arriving on 5/12, so we have two weeks for demo, framing, rough plumb/electric, and drywall. Hope to get a coat of paint on also. Top selection, fab and install, and final plumbing will eat up a couple week also. Then there is backsplash, flooring, trims, final paint, appliances etc. I think 6 weeks we can be 99 percent completed, but having her prepared for worst case gives us wiggle room.

Custom Cabinets in Hartford County Connecticut4-6 weeks3 weeks not even knocking yourself out, done lots of them myself. Ctops take anywhere between 3-10 days after templating.Around here getting a guy to template takes 3-4 weeks.A lot depends on many things  

In normal times it takes my stone fabricator 2 weeks to come and template and another 2 weeks to fabricate and install. In normal times. Now, a lot longer.If everything was on site, and the client had unlimited funds to have all the subs on standby, and it was managed like a military parade, maybe.Building Contractor
Electrical ContractorIt really depends on what's being done, subs involved and their schedule, material availability and inspections...

And like pricing, a lot of that is going to depend on your local market...This was all helpful. Thanks for the reality check.

As I play this back in my mind, and wonder what has happened, it went something like this. My own schedule deadline on this one was Memorial Day (buddies and I will then take a one week excursion to a cabin and lake ("lac") in Canada.)

But about two weeks ago, I was informed that client's mom is moving in, and it needs to done by her arrival May 14. Ok, I noted it, but didn't expect all this late apprehension, because we had just finished another job with them.. which went well and everyone is happy.

So something happened that I still don't understand. Maybe it was the payment schedule or the numbers themselves.

This is the same house as that bathroom/office conversion. Technically, we could have done everything together, but we needed to see how the first job would go with this client.Almost everyone I have delt with on counters got it back to me in a week.
So that a week right there and then final plumbing hook ups and tile backsplash if applicable. That could spread out a week.MarkJames said:

I politely told them I can't get the materials by then, which is true. But I wasn't going to drop everything to get this done either. There is only one client I have that gets that kind of attention and it's not them.

Custom Cabinets in Hartford County ConnecticutOld old house on Daniel St in Portsmouth NH (@Kingcarpenter1 ). Word on the street is, one of the occupants was this Italian guy who would cook whatever he had on hand and people who come in for lunch or whatever and get a serving. Looks like at some point in the family's history, they tried their hand at interior demo, starting on the top (third) floor. They dropped a bunch of horsehair plaster on the floor and started filling these old paper flour bags. I can't imagine why, but at some point they must've got tired of carrying heavy paper bags of mixed lathe/plaster down the old stairs.

This is how they left it:
































I conducted some low-grade research into the Seaboard Allied Milling Corporation Company Timeline | Seaboard to figure out when this work might have been done. I believe the bags date from between 1965, when they acquired the Buffalo NY mill, and 1980, when they moved their headquarters to Kansas.

I might send them an email and ask when they stopped using these bags - I figure if they have such a richly detailed company history on their website, they'd probably enjoy the photos and the mystery.

Anyway, I thought the history buffs would find this amusing.“If you need a machine and don't buy it, then you will ultimately find that you have paid for it and don't have it.”
- Henry FordI see a zip code on the bag, but that doesn’t help date it because zip started in 1963.Per some Googling:

Styrolid was a trademark from 1969 until it was canceled in 2021

StyroCup was a trademark from 1963 to 1984

Both companies went through a bunch of acquisitions, so they may have stopped being made before being canceled.

Probably gets it down to 1969-1984.Cool stuff. Looks like 100 lb sacs. These yuppies nowadays ain’t gonna pack anything near that. 20 lb would be a stretch. Cool stuff Reg

Cool. Your wife’s family would know the street. Close to Daniel Street Tavern, which is a landmark dive bar. It’s a cool spot because one block away is a brand new building going in that required deep foundations and a butt load of steel. Old and the new.

MY question for you is this: has anyone on here managed to remove
The new construction windows without taking all the siding off?

our second thought is to cut the windows out leave the nail flange on the house slip the new windows in any one done this as well? How did you finish the outside? J-channel? Azek?Any pictures?I can get them tomorrowSo you ordered windows then measured afterwards? Even if you cut the flange without cutting through the siding how you are going to flash the new window without getting under the siding? Don't they have J channel now?I have done it before and it's a mess. As you probably know, a replacement window is meant to be pushed up against some type of blind stop/trim board. The only way to properly seal the window from water is to be able to caulk the window to that stop/trim board. If you are simply cutting the new construction window out by cutting the nail flange off then you would have nothing to butt your replacement window to. In which case you would have to put a piece of PVC trim outside to butt your window against and at that point you may have to cut the siding back anyways because you are essentially shrinking the window opening from the outside, assuming that there is J channel on the house and you have to put that trim on the inside of the J channel. Your trim unless very narrow could end up covering alot of the window frame and looking silly. If it is an option to cancel your window order do it ASAP. Removing siding to put in a new construction window is not that much work. That being said once you get the siding off the window install itself goes very quickly anyways.No he didn’t order windows then measure. We we went to measure them and pull a practically charred frame out we found out they have flanges. I apologize.NMThe option to pull the all the of the siding is not in the budget unless me and the laborer do it on the side and for cheaper( which we’ve talked about). All the windows are getting replaced and they’ve been paid and delivered for. There’s about 7 windows in the whole place but a lot of empty wall space meaning alot of siding to remove.Your boss effed up he should eat the cost to do it correctly.MyFirstRodeo said:

Being there are vinyl windows already there is more than likely trim on the inside that the windows are butting up to. And yes the fin could be cut and the new one slid in, and fastened like a retrofit. They would need to be caulked on the outside to seal up. Not an ideal situation.Remove J channel and cut back siding enough so that you can nail/screw a piece of PVC trim/brickmould to the house as a stop. Still have to put the J back and nail it which is a pain in the ass as you have to hold the properly sized back siding out of the way as you do this. Install window from the inside and now you have something to caulk your window to. Also caulk the trim material to the J channel with a bead of clear silicone to keep water out.Randy Bush said:

Not necessarily a trim board/stop already existing. A new construction window usually has the J channel butted right to the window frame unless the window has built in J channel. Assuming you meant to say that there is likely trim on the outside as any trim on the inside would be removed anyways.MyFirstRodeo said:

There is so much wrong in this post. Caulking the window to the interior trim won't do anything to keep out rain. With vinyl, you must remove the siding. No other way to do it.

You don't need to pull all the siding. Just the areas around the windows. Vinyl is quick to remove and replace.

There are specific ways to seal a window. These are even more important with vinyl.

Your boss screwed up. We all do, but it needs to come off. He could just pay you piece work to do the vinyl. As long as you make minimum wage, you're good to go.

Hopefully you will make more, but it would get him out of a jam.

I found a few of those by Renewal also, they just bent an aluminum L screwed it to the window frame and it laid back over the siding. You could pull the aluminum out and see the fiberglass insulation. Was not sealed at allDavidkatubi said:

All you need to do is submit a supplement to the insurance company to replace all the siding and house wrap for the entire house. 

If it cost less to do something, that goes into the contractors pocket just as when it costs more it comes out if a contractors pocket. Insurance work is different. It goes off the scope and the scope is line itemed by Xactimate, the estimating program.

You do not have to barrow from Peter to pay Pal when doing insurance work.

In an insurance claim, when you have to do something that would not have normally needed to be done had it not been for the cause (I.E. the fire), its called "approximate cause".The insurance policy will cover the additional cost as a result.

Tell your boss to simply submit a supplement to the carrier. Just include an explinatio. With photos of why you have to remove the siding. Explain that the new siding will not match the existing color do to aging. 

He should remember you when he gets the supplement check and give you a bonus. If he doesn't, find someone else to work for.Customer wants me to Reno their stair rail, they don’t want oak. Not sure how to do it, the original stair rail had odd construction, they just screwed the rails to the skirt. 
They want something more like the pic with the white newel posts, just not sure how to accomplish that. It would look terrible to bolt the 4x4 posts on the skirt board. I could mount the 4x4s on the treads, but that would eat into the width of the stairs (currently 40”) and I’d have to rip out the carpet and put a finish board for a tread (currently has plywood under the carpet and it wouldn’t look good to just cut out the carpet around the posts). Customer isn’t excited about narrowing the stairs.
Any ideas?I would have it engineered. You may be able to open up from below, add blocking and then use retrofit post brackets. The ones that you drill into the center of the post.

There is no easy or cheap way to do it.

Also, that stair wouldn't pass code here. Can't have open risers and those rods won't work, as they will spread more then 4 inches 

You need a pro to design it.

You get to figure out how to skin this cat and give your customer what they want so that they will pay you, in a perfect world.Live NOW…….in the NOWAgree with the pic not meeting code. You can have open risers, but they must also be less than 4" just like rods/balusters per the IRC. Do you have a pic of the the existing stairs to put this into perspective? In addition, an introduction from you on what type of contractor you are, where you're located, and your experience with staircase work will help us to provide you with better advice.All I see in that example picture is someone in socks sliding their ankle underneath the bar and snapping their leg. It also looks like notched posts. 

So if your customer wants that you are either going to have the posts fabricated out of steel or you are going to put up full 4x4's on the skirt or she loses stair width. 
Get paid for the design time and back and forth, there is going to be a lot.robert c1 said:

I think you’re confusing the pictures. The black & wite stairs with the open risers is a internet picture of what they like, the picture with the carpeted stairs is what they have. I read that they like the modern handrail, hopefully they aren’t expecting a conversion to open risers.Could go full crazy and build a new wall on the face of the existing one and then mount the 4x4 to the new studs. 
Then of course they'd need all new treads, drywall, and trim, plus paint.... But they'll get their railing and keep the stair width....How to figure your pricing:

Custom Cabinets in Hartford County ConnecticutHello,

I am going to be finishing this basement and am using a dri core type sub floor them laminate on top. The problem is right near the bottom of the stairs and right in front of the fruit cellar door is a backflow water valve and sump pump.

I was going to build a little room for the pump but need to hide the backflow valve while still making it accessible.

The only thing I can think of is making a sort of lift able door and have multiple pieces of the flooring connected yet loose on top of the backflow valve so that is can be lifted and the valve be accessed (hope I described that clearly). Just wondering if you guys have any other ideas as I think this will be unsightly











Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkNew 2015 building code to have a backflow valve in every house. Really sucks in the placement of most of them. I also wonder if anyone has come up with a good idea? I would think to just go over top of it(keep measurements of the location incase). Keep access doors at all stack clean outs for access to sewers if any problem arise it can be fixed from them instead of the backflow access. 


Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkWhat else can you do but frame in an opening and make up a loose panel out of the flooring and be able to lift it out. Maybe anchor it with magnets or something. 

The best way to do it would have been to locate the valve in a logical location.Morning Wood said:

It probably was a logical location--for an unfinished basement.

Tough call as to whether we should go out of our way when building something like that to allow for the possibility that someone might want to finish it some unknown number of years down the road.Tinstaafl said:

I can only speak for Canada (Toronto area) but I think more than half the homes will eventually have a finished basement, but then again without knowing the layout the owner wants you can never know the "perfect" place. Although 3' ahead is the fruit/cold cellar so that would have been a better place.

Look at the sump pump as well, just as bad of a location

That's pretty much the point, isn't it? Might as well try to outguess that squirrel in the middle of the road as you're bearing down on it. :laughing:Of what use is your finished basement with a 12" of liquid feces floating in it.

Raise the lid, leave it visible where the Home owner can service the valve so it actually works when the sewer system fails or is plugged by the neighbors. Leave the HO with a list of maintenance chores that MUST be performed semi-annually to insure survival of all the non waterproof stuff you installed.... 

The back flow preventer has to be the last thing on a GRAVITY driven system, thus it location is very limited.....:whistling

If it must be "hidden" build a 'Warm' pantry closet in front of the fruit cellar, the fruit cellar will stay colder....

By the picture, there is a good chance you could saw up the floor in the fruit cellar and add a back flow device, and remove the flapper on the now abandoned one.......Maybe not as the waterline is usually above the sewer....
If you'd reverse the door on the f. cellar it'd open completely...
IMO, installing anything that can't get wet and washed on the floor or first 12-8" of walls in any basement is a un needed risk, I've demoed many a "finished" basement due to a minor water event.

I see a Vapour barrier, Isn't there already a dampproof coating on the concrete walls exterior? Thus TWO vapour barriers creating wet/moldy spots.....sooner or later?

If there is an existing STORM sewer/or day light, near the house below the crock elevation you could retro fit a solid drain tile to it with another one way valve, and eliminate the sump pump except for end of world flood type emergencies.

Covering or hiding the one way valve is like welding the engine hood shut, it will lead to an early death of the engine/ basement remodel.
Hidden axles NEVER get greased or inspected.

But, hey we'll all working our corners, clocking right?......:jester:I might be an Idiot, but I know things that You don't: Please wait till after you get my know-how to insult me....projectpete19 said:

Any suggestions?Hello everyone. I need to frame-in an alcove to turn it into a bedroom. What tips and tricks do you all use to cut back the carpet where the plates will go so that just some cutting and re-stretching are needed to fit the carpet around the new walls/doorways? I have never built walls in an area already carpeted. I did a little research and one person talked about having to tack the carpet on either side of the plate before cutting since the carpet is stretched to fit the existing room and not doing so would cause problems. Any insights would be much appreciated.Just guessing, but maybe just peel the carpet back from the wall that's getting an alcove. Then layout bottom plate locations on the floor (in pencil) and install tack strips along where the plates are going. Replace carpet, stretch if needed to get back to original position/tension. Slice carpet between tack strips, open/spread out the cut like you're doing surgery, install bottom plates, frame walls blah blah blah, and then do a final kick to get carpet just right, tuck in with stair tool.

One concern is if the carpet is stretched differently in either dimension, what happens to the corners of the cut that you make. Are they going to look wonky when you try to tuck them in? I don't know. Something to consider.

Depending on the layout, you might consider cutting the carpet and seaming after. Pics?

Again, just guessing.“If you need a machine and don't buy it, then you will ultimately find that you have paid for it and don't have it.”

I have built walls on top of carpet more than once. I would frame your walls on floor & stand up level & plumb. Screw top & bottom to adjoining plates. Large butterflies to ceiling if not perpendicular. Red Heads to bottom plates or Tapcons/screws. I use Red Heads. If carpet ever needs removed they can cut @ plate

MikeForgot rip base to match if needed. Existing base should match if left up 1/2” or so. No worries about seams, bad cut etc.

MikeI guess prescribing labor intensive courses of action is sorta my thing. I'm insane like that.

I like stuff layered neatly. Sorta drives me bonkers when tile is butted against baseboard and that sort of thing.

Go ahead and frame the wall on the carpet if you must, but please don't put linoleum on top of it all!“If you need a machine and don't buy it, then you will ultimately find that you have paid for it and don't have it.”

Sent from my SM-G930V using TapatalkThanks for the replies. I'm surprised at the over the carpet suggestion like mrcat, but if it works then why not. This is on a second floor so attaching to wood and perpendicular to CJs on the main wall, but not the closet. I do have areas on either side of the wall outside the room where the base would span where the plates are and are not on top of carpet, if I put the new wall on top of carpet. And also in a couple corners within the room. This would not look different between the two as far as how the carpet would tuck under the base?

For reference, the wall will go across the opening in the pic with the door on the far left, then a closet on the right with the front of it facing to the left.I cut strips of plywood 4 1/2 inches Wide, And screw them to the floor where I want the center of the plate to go, I get a carpet knife and cut each side, use a multi master to cut the baseboard and carpet tack strips away from your flooring, install the framing on the center of your cut and leave the carpet to the flooring guy!The Following User Says Thank You to Snobnd For This Useful Post: LeoKingcarpenter1 said:

Generally, on a higher budget job, they would also be replacing floor coverings.Hi all,
Long time first time.
Last week I was stripping some adhesive off a garage floor in a house built in 1946. Consulted with the previous owner and deduced that the adhesive was put in 97 so safe to say no asbestos. So I went along my merry way and started stripping the floor with a floor stripper.
Everything was going smoothly until I got to a small 4'x4' bathroom in the garage. I notice that the adhesive wasn't peeling off as smoothly and realized that there were tiles on the ground. They were 9x9 and I assumed they were asbestos. Did a pre-damp of the top surface and got them up by chiseling with the floor stripper and smashing the tile with a hammer to break off larger pieces. I was wearing a respirator, but not a space suit. Got the job done, and took off all my clothes before entering the main house detached from the garage and went straight to the shower. Definitely was an ordeal, and now a week later I am worried about longterm repercussions.
Since then I have mopped the floor, wet cleaned, and have had two hepa filters running constantly in the room. Got the tiles tested just to be sure, and they came back negative on the top adhesive, negative on the bottom black mastic and positive 6% chrysotile for the middle section.
My questions are:

I am aware that asbestos exposure is only super severe if repeatedly exposed for years. I am wondering if going into the garage for its future intended use is going to give me and my partner prolonged exposure and risk us to lung cancer and meezo feel me ooooo ma.
Was the amount of tiles, the square space of the bathroom, and percentage of the tiles a negligible amount to where I may be over worrying?
I have spoken with a few medical professionals and abatement people who said that recent studies have shown that chrysotile has proven to be LESS severe (still bad) than other types of asbestos. I.e the lungs can clear it after a certain amount of time and it doesn't become a permanent fixture in your body's biology.
Should I be worried about tracking any into the house? I took off all my clothes, except underwear, and went straight to shower but wonder if it was in my hair or something?
Do you think I'll ever get married?
Thank you for all your help and insights! I know these asbestos posts get a little old, but abatement is a billion dollars and I want to be sure of any immediate risks before looking into that option. But maybe I am over worrying.
Thank you!

TomThanks Tom. The search term "pusher" is something I never thought of.Hello all, 
I’m on a project that consists of renovating a old house that used balloon framing. I have noticed some issues right off the bat. The 2nd floor is sagging which I think is due to improper fastening of the joists to the studs. The joists are not sitting on a ledger (there isn’t one) and I’m not comfortable until I see a hanger in use. Would it be possible to brace up 8’ of floor at a time and add a ledger by cutting the joists back far enough to slip a 2x8 in? Could I straighten the floor and I go? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
ThanksThis is contractor 101, but I'll go ahead and answer. Yes.I'd fund out why it's sagging first and check out the condition if the framing before deciding what to do

Ledgers in these were typically 1X4 cut into the studs. Joists sit on top if the ledger, it's actually a good system.The house had a basement added to it recently. Which was a result of a failing foundation. The area in question is above the worst of the settling before the new basement walls where blocked up. I guess my real question is would 8’ be too much to work with at a time. Without a risk of the wall starting to bow outward.BTW, if you cut the joists back and slip a 2X8 ledger up on the face of the studs, it's going to have to be through bolted to the studs.You have to brace it from the inside and outside, unless the studs are attached to a sill plate that is anchored to the foundation.hdavis said:

Why do you say that it has to be through-bolted? 

I believe that that is not prescriptive but engineered.

Because the prescriptive uses the let in ledger. If it's just face nailing in a ledger, you have the same problem as face nailing in a deck ledger, it's weak.

Not that it wouldn't stay there for a long time.....So 3 GRK structural lags wouldn’t be sufficient in each stud? Yes the exterior wall is anchored to the foundation.If the joists run to the end it's the same work to cut in 2x4 plates. I've done that on a fire job. We converted to partial platform framing. 
I have think 6ft at a clip.That’s crappy part, they don’t.Access from the outside for a rim?Negative. The existing joists only overlap the studs by roughly 1.5”You have to 'let in' a 1x4 ledger on the studs, as HDavis suggested. Then install fire blocking. The sagging joists are likely due to the original joists being undersized. I've worked on older homes that had rough-sawn 2x8s spanning 18 feet, grossly undersized, naturally they sagged a lot after a century. The fix is to get a proper plate or ledger under either end, and installing sistered or new joists engineered for that span and floor plate depth. In my case, spanning 18 feet with only an 8" depth to work with meant using engineered wood and fitch plates. My building department also required an engineer's stamp before approving permits. so throwing a bunch of #1 SPF in there wasn't going to cut it.WRiowa said:

I didn't see this before replying, but this isn't typical of balloon framing, there were hacks back then too. You might be tearing out a floor and putting in proper framing.WRiowa said:

That would have to be calculated based on floor loads. No way for me to tell.

Like a lot of old houses, there seems to be a lot going on here. Can you do 8' at a time? From what you've said, yes.I’m hoping to leave what is there and fix it as structurally sound as I can get it but if I don’t feel comfortable after a test run I will ultimately be replacing the floor. More expensive for the owner but if that is what needs to happen it will. Thanks everyone for the insight and good conversation. Just starting out and it is greatly appreciated.Can't you just lolly column the existing floor, cut in your plate/ledger and be done with it?

Then sister whatever is needed?

Sent from my SM-N975U using TapatalkMy vote is inadequate joist depth. I've seen 2x6s 24" OC spanning 14' in a 100 year old balloon framed house. The floors were trampolines. The joist to stud connection never failed.“If you need a machine and don't buy it, then you will ultimately find that you have paid for it and don't have it.”
- Henry FordMy objection is philosophical, not technical, in nature. The house has sagging floors. Big deal. They've probably been sagging for 90 of its 100 years. No, it's not up to modern code. Whoop-de-do. It hasn't fallen down yet and probably has another several hundred years left. Shove some fire stopping into those stud bays and call 'er good please.Hello... this will be long -- looking for advice. Thanks in advance!

When I purchased my house, we had them tent. It was a whole ordeal, so there is no warranty and the company and I cut ties afterwards.

I noticed some termite kickout piles showing up on top of the tile (from between the tiles) between the shower and the toilet.

I called another company to do a spot treatment. They decided to treat in the actual bathroom (third floor) and the ceiling of the second floor directly under the bathroom.

They performed the spot treatment and left -- shortly after they left, the drywall of the second floor ceiling collapsed.

It turns out the wax ring had blown out and the subfloor of the third floor bathroom that supports the toilet/toilet flange is rotted out. I vacuumed up the area and the wood was so destroyed that my shop vac sucked most of subfloor plywood right out. The structural joist looks OK, but the other TJI joist was rotted through. 

I am a very experienced DIYer, but have never done tile. I have pretty much every tool (except tiling tools). I want to repair this without completely remodeling the bathroom, as all tile is still in tact.

My current plan is as follows:


Remove all of the rotted wood.
Use an oscillating multi tool to remove all nails from between the wall framing and the joist.
Treat all wood with boracare
Hammer in 3/4" plywood between the wall framing and the joists
Add a 3/4" plywood board to span the distance between the joists and the toilet flange
Add another 3/4" plywood board below that to hold up the top three boards listed above
Sister a 2x10 to the 4x12 joist to act as support + act as a "block" to support the plywood subfloor patch layers
Sister a 2x4 onto the TJI joist to act as a "block" for the plywood subfloor patch layers
Add horizontal 2x4s between the joists to support the plywood sub floor layers


I tried to explain this as best I can in the attached drawings.

My key questions are --

1. This seems like a feasible solution to me, but I am worried about the bottom X inches of plywood that look rotted out behind the wall tiling. Do I just seal it up and leave those as is? I do not see a way to replace that section of wood without tearing off the wall tiling.

2. Do I need to evaluate all of the damage behind the wall tiling? I don't really know how I would do that..should I call a structural guy or a termite guy?

3. At what point to I need to say **** it and just pull all tiling and replace the subfloor and the wall framing? I really don't want to do this.

By the time you do all that half-ass ineffectual work, you could have the floor and wall ripped up and you can see what's what. Then you go buy some wood and fix it properly.

Your plan is stupid.

We apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused. This thread has been closed.One of my neighbors is selling their house,building inspector failed them. The ex husband tried to finish the basement himself,  what a disaster. So no permits, no fire blocking etc. My neighbor asked me to do the work. So I called the inspector on behalf of the home owner and asked him to meet me at the property to go over the problem areas. He refused. So with talking to him on the phone he seems to be more concerned with the existing exterior walls and wants them fire blocked????? I thought he would be more concerned with the walls the home owner put up, but evidently not. the basement is huge 55x30
so since the inspector is losing his job may 1st or may 31 I forget,
Maybe hes breaking the homeowners balls?? My question is how the hell do you bid something like this? Im thinking 3k. Some spots are so hard to get to. other spots have block walls and were fine as is 11 years ago and are still untouched yet inspector wants them fire blocked........... Comments welcome.
The house is under contract to be sold 4/31/2012.I doubt the inspector is just being a diick. I had a customer that bought a house and had to make the seller bring all the construction they did up to code.

With basements, fireblocking is more critical around the perimeter of the sills and rim joist. Some unfaced insulation or therma fiber will prevent a fire from shooting from the walls through the floor system and stop open raceways. Another way would have been to rock the ceiling areas where walls butt up to before hand.When I saw your post, I knew it had to be NJ...We do "after the fact code violation repairs" all the time since the new law took effect. 
Most town ordinances adapted to have Building department conduct inspection prior to closing and bring everything up to the code and issue Certificate Of Occupancy. If they don't have a record of permit being issued for basement, deck, etc, they will have all inspectors go through the house and write up all violations and make the Property seller get a permit. In some cases they will make the HO take the ceiling fan out if there wasn't a permit taking out for it and replace with a regular fixture if there is no fan box... In most cases electrician has to sign and seal a letter stating that everything meets the code.

In basements like in your situation, they will make the HO provide horizontal fire-stop along perimeter of the ceiling of all exterior walls (Some towns will require vertical as well 10' OC) etc. If plumbing involved, they will make sure it is vented properly, etc...Same with electrical, bring everything to the code.I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​Thanks for the replies fellas, So now to hit them with a price.....
Its a huge basement Im thinking like $2800.00 for a 55x35. Some spots are gonna be a real challange....... Any opinions?No one knows what your thinking and no one sees what your seeing. Nor do we all operate at the same expenses.
Just break it into time & material or figuire how many days it will take you put it all together.What will the inspector require for inspection? 

Fire blocks are not required nor would they do any good in an open and unfinished basement. Once you put in a ceiling, you separate spaces then you must have fire-blocks at all passageways between the spaces. 

You will probably need to fireblock at the stairs and all walls if the ceiling is below the top of the stud cavity. You will need to deal with properly blocking/sealing at all penetrations of those blocks, including insuring that all wiring is properly spaced and the holes for wiring and plumbing are properly sealed. Then, be prepared to show the inspector every one of those locations.Patriotism is being loyal to your country all the time and your government when it deserves it. Mark TwainDoes it have to be blocking? Can it be fire rated insulation or fire rated foam of some sort maybe for the tight spots?Yes it can be fire-rated insulation, fire rated caulk, is what we use and 1/2" sheetrock for vertical separation... in some cases for horizontal also if applicable.I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​Braciole said:

Most people nail a plate to the joist then frame under it and rock everything last. This leaves a chase/raceway connecting all the bay's and cavities around the perimeter behind the wall.Braciole said:

I find that kinda odd 1/2 drywall isnt fire rated. only 5/8 is. none of the above is really fire rated... ohwell drywall it is.Drywall has ratings...I think 3/8" is 15 min---1/2" 20 min..5/8" is 30 5/8" xp--40 minBraciole said:

Be careful about confusing the terms. Fire blocking is really draft stopping. The "fire blocks" don't really stop fires, they block air.Before I ever got into construction as a business endeavor I had another career. That required me to live in a bigger city and as a result I had to store a very special classic car that I have had since 1987. The garage I kept it at was next to a roofing company. The fire inspector made his rounds and violated the whole garage because there was not any fire blocking between the units. It was a typical bar joist concrete block structure and there was about 8" open space at the top of each sidewall to the next unit.
Long story short, landlord hires a guy to restore all the fire blocking. Two weeks later..one of the roofers passed out on the couch in the garage next to my car and let a cigarette drop and catch the whole place on fire!. he survived and the roofing company took a huge loss....the fire did not breach to my unit..and although the firefighters had to flood the whole building to get the fire under control..my car was essentially untouched.
Fire blocking is crucial to limiting/containing the damage..I am a GC now and I always respect the concept of fire blocking and limit my penetrations to the absolute minimum and fire caulk or drywall repair where required..
That was my baby..I still have the car..and I have 4 kids now on top of it..so they are what I think of when I see firewalls..No air..... no fire. That is the purpose of ''draft stops''(Fire Blocks)

We had a plumber soldering some copper on an ext wall and he caught the insulation on fire. we were all running around looking for water. The draftstops kept that fire from going up into the floor joist areas.(ceiling was drywalled) If they had not been there we could have had big trouble!

I've heard theirs a video showing a flame that shoots through a hole drilled in a draftstop,looks like a blow torch. Just to illustrate what happens in a fire.Expect the UnexpectedBig Shoe is right, there is a difference between this 2 terms.

Fire blocking is commonly used to separate an area within concealed spaces at mid span section to create vertical or horizontal separation to prevent fire spread within concealed spaces, and to maintain the structural integrity of the building during a fire.

Draft stop is installed to restrict air movement within open space of the concealed areas of building i.e crawl space, floor and ceiling separation,etc. 

Draft stopping location is mostly required to be installed at horizontal to vertical transition and penetration points of the building.i,e around plumbing pipes and HVAC ducts, wiring,etc and by code it must be installed over so many SF of area,i.e drop ceilings,wall separation,etc. What draft stop basically does is preventing oxygen from feeding the fire before it can spread through the structure and destroy the entire building.I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​greg24k brings up a point that I had forgotten. The IRC requires draft-stopping within enclosed spaces so that the open area is no more than 1000 square feet. If the ceiling space is open above and enclosed, your inspector may require you to show full draft-stopping that separates that space into two disconnected spaces. These spaces are created by suspended ceilings and open web trusses. Even if the framing is dimension lumber (or I Joists) he could insist on seeing draft-stopping at ducts, plumbing, and electric.

Here, our inspectors require the space be separated approximately in half. They (plans-examiners and inspectors) would not accept a 1200 square foot space being divided into 999 and 201 square feet. 

Around here, since the housing bust started, inspectors have been going out of their way to find every little non-compliance item they can find in order to require re-inspection which further justifies their continuing employment. 

good luck.Patriotism is being loyal to your country all the time and your government when it deserves it. Mark TwainI agree they are 2 different things. We are doing exceptionly well on this Job we almost finished all the drywall today (2 guys). I made a couple of templates we should be done tomorrow. Im very happy.:thumbsup:Does anybody think this kid of thing is right?

I know this is not the question posted, but as it looks like that one was answered satisfactorily, so I'm going to question the premise.

Why should anyone have the right to hold up the sale of private property based on something like fire blocking?

Don't get me wrong - fire blocking is a good thing, and should always be done as a matter of good practice.

My belief is that we should not be forced into any of these things - much like wearing a seat belt is a good idea, but should not be mandatory. It's a personal freedom issue, and to view it as a "well, you ought to do it anyway so what's the big deal" issue is wrong.

What happened to "caveat emptor" ?

Let the potential buyer decide whether he wants to buy the house "as is" or not. And please don't give me any song and dance about the buyer not being equipped to understand quality or good building practice - the private market can always provide an expert for things in which we are not ourselves competent.

The codes used to just be about safety - which I still disagree with, but now they are policing quality and efficiency and way overstepping their bounds.

Everybody wants to rule the world, I guess, but that's not what we should allow to happen here.

If you look at the history of gov't regulation and the 18th amendment, you will see that when people had enough of gov't interference, there was not only a political movement to stop it, there were many instances of "revenuers" going missing.

I wonder how far we are from history repeating itself, or if there's too much complacency or fear for that anymore.

Anyway, rant over - I'd just like to hear what the percentages are.

BobLooking at getting some remodeling estimating software. I am a small (less than 5 employees) remodeling company that does interior and exterior remodels. We sub out the plumbing, electrical, concrete, HVAC, and excavation. I am looking for a book that will help check my numbers. What are you other small guys using. Are they all about the same. Does it really help with your estimates. I am thinking exactimate is the way to go especially when bidding insurance jobs. Any ideas? Thanks all.Dubuque Remodeling

XactRemodel gives you almost the same features, and pricing found in Xactimate for about half the cost (minus cleaning, mobile home data, and certain renovation activities generally not related to remodeling ) - The other good part about XactRemodel is it allows you to price your work using either a markup or margin whereas XM only allows the markup method

I must caution you though, if you don't know your numbers (i.e. how long something will take, or how much that vanity will cost), and all the small little line items that are required, you can loose your shirt no matter which program or book you use. If you do look into other programs or books to help, you should also look at how often it is updated - if they only update the program yearly & miss a few price increases, you can also end up in a world of hurtSLS Construction & Building Solutions LLC Our Blog - The HTRCI think I have my numbers and time tables down pretty good by now.

I am probably going to get roasted for asking this, but I do light remodels and rehabs that are items like drywall, paint, trim, flooring, fixtures, etc. We aren't moving walls or replacing the plumbing/wiring in a house. Isn't there something between the typical real estate investor's (my main clients) $??/foot model and Xactimate? Am I the only person looking for such a thing?Software Choices

If you are planning to do insurance work, then you should invest in a unit pricing software that the insurance companies use, and to my knowledge most use Xactimate. This will get you on the same page with the adjuster faster.

However, most of the software out there is very complicated and the prices/descriptions are generic (plus the software is expensive). For a small remodeler, if you know what you're doing (as in you know how to price and describe your work), then I would suggest something like AccurateEstimator2.0, it is inexpensive, simple, and you can put your own prices and descriptions in easily (for the unknown price items, buy the Hometech printed price books and go to Home Depot's website for material prices).

Best of luck.I use google docs, where I have built custom spreadsheets. My basic estimate spreadsheet is organized by trade (demo, framing, carpentry, etc.) and I have a group of cells that allow me to set prices for hourly, per square foot, per linear foot, per item prices. For example, once I have entered the sq.ft. of an item, I can massage the per square foot price and get a result instantly. I modify the spreadsheet, adding lines or deleting sections on an ad hoc basis. The really great thing for me about google docs is, since I have a partner, we can both be sitting at our desks at home, talk on the speakerphone as necessary, and edit the spreadsheets at the same time in real time. I even know what cell he is on because it is outlined in color. It is crude, but by building the project part by part on paper, we rarely get bit in the butt by unexpected cost over runs, and I think I can safely say we have never wound up upside down on a project.What is the cost of Xactimate?

Would you consider sharing that Google Sheet?I recently began my kitchen remodel and FINALLY received my cabinets. We were talked into the plywood upgrade and I am wondering if what we received, is technically plywood. I removed one piece of the cabinets quickly noticing it was not square (base piece for cabinets). When I picked up the piece it literally fell apart. It appears that the pocket hole screws used were not screwed in deep enough, no glue, and just seemed like lazy work. This damage also helped me notice that the exterior portion of the "plywood" was actually 1/8 inch mdf. I had never seen this before. Can they sell this as "plywood"?. It seems a bit deceptive or at the very least a false representation of what I upgraded to purchse.

I found that the product is called "Combi-Core". The websites states "Combi-Core is constructed of veneer core inner plies with MDF cross bands next to the face and back. Offers similar strength and stability to veneer core but has the void-free surface quality of MDF. This visibly reduces core veneer telegraphing.". Seem spot on to what I received.

I am a man of many trades. I did general construction and house remodeling for 7 years. I have already installed 2500 square ft of hardwood in my house, moved the plumbing to account for the new kitchen island, and I am in the process of updating and fixing the electrical in the house. I have had a variety of different trades, from bartending to disaster relief and reconstruction to cybersecurity (and many more). I was in the military, served my time and now I am remodeling my new house. If interested I also brew beer, beekeeping, woodworking, avid disc golfer, and much more! I will post this question in the DIY chatroom. It appears I do not match the forums criteria for users.My two cents, 
If my cabinet guy "talked" my customer into "plywood" it better be 3/4" actual cabinet grade plywood. When I say "all plywood construction" I mean all plywood in the boxes. To me that Combicore seems like 3/8" plywood with 2 MDF veneers. It may achieve the legal definition of plywood, but if you are talking an all plywood box, you are only giving the manufacturer 3/8" to hit actual plywood with fasteners. Unless you were told what combicore is at the get go, I would feel that the salesperson was disingenuous at best.Are your cabinets painted? Because of the telegraphing issue, it's what they are used a lot for... If they are Combi-core and no glue was used, it's not surprising that the screws came out if not long enough, because it's relying on the MDF top veneer for the strength...Does the manufacturer of the "plywood" sell it as plywood?shesbros said:

100% correct. My feelings exactly. I will most likely will contact my supplier, but I have a feeling they will push back and say "its plywood". They did specifically say plywood was the better option compared to MDF. But MDF is in this product so it definitely is not was I was sold into purchasing.KAP said:

It is painted. The more research I conduct on this product the more I understand why they would use this, but I was sold on a "plywood" upgrade. Nothing was mentions of plywood wrapped in MDF. It did appear that the main cabinets had glue. I can visibly see glue in a few spots. I have two large 96 inch pantry cabinets which they built separate cabinet bases for. The cabinet bases were the pieces that were sub standard to which led me to notices the outer layer was MDF. The screws pulled out of the mdf when I lifted up the base and messed up the base. It is in a spot which wont be visible when the project is completed, but is it my job to fix the bases? or should I send them back to have it done properly?hdavis said:

I purchased the cabinets from a cabinet store. They used Showplace EVO to manufacture the cabinets. The manufacturers website only mentions upgrading to plywood, but nothing specific to combi-core material used. I'm unsure if they use terminology for the product, but my understanding is that plywood did not include MDF. Personally, I don't think this type of material should be labeled as "plywood" and should be clearly identified as a hybrid material.stillstillington said:

Dude, you're a man of many trades and you seriously are asking this question? If you plan on keeping the cabinets overall, and all there is a base or two with an issue, why would you waste the time to send it back, WAIT for a replacement, holding everything else up, when some glue and some screws can alleviate all that? Especially when it's in an area that you won't see?

At most, maybe bring it to their attention and see if you can get a credit of some sort because they are responsible for inferior craftsmanship...

That said, last person to touch it is responsible for it...MDX—it is listed as a plywood. When it comes to painted cabinets it provides a superior painted surface. Gives you the strength of plywood and the surface finish of MDF.

I also use a hybrid MDX which is MDF exposed one side and maple, walnut or RSWO on the other side. Best of all worlds.

Looking for opinions on wear and tear for the floor joists and whether it is normal for a house of this age. These photos are from the crawlspace. First few are to establish overall condition followed by some areas I think are red flags. I see dry rot, some decent size cracking on a beam, dry rot at key joints, and multiple areas the rot was so bad that someone sistered some small sections of joist in (as in the rotted foot or two plus another couple feet). I would guess the sistered in pieced are a good 20+ years old themselves. The dry rotted locations not sistered, a good whack with a hammer is likely to take a chunk out of them. The living room above the large floor joist are pictured (also with the cracked beam) has a ceiling that sags about 1.5" over 14'. The floor itself (that sits on these joists), I am measuring a 1 5/8" slope over that same 14'. Both measured via self plumbing laser line and a tape measure. Yes a mildly aware person can feel that slope in the floor.

Yes many of those rotted and sister joist are on the very same wall that there is frost on in the attic. That said, on the exterior of this wall is a place where snow piles so I expect there to be a drainage issue. Cannot see for certain due to 3' of snow piled there and lack of interested to shovel out in 10* F weather.

1) Is this joist/beam damage typical wear/tear for a 100 year old home with a crawlspace in the midwest?

2) Ballpark, what do you think this could cost to repair $5K, $10K, $20K of repairs? What I have photoed below is the bulk of the damage.

Yeah I have got the tools and ability to cut, jack, crib, and sister this into submission. But its not my cup o'tea and would rather leave it to someone with experience.robh1 said:

Looks like fun.

I once looked at a 100 or so year old building in Pulaski NY to buy with a friend. Big mixed use, it was a total dump. Built on a dry “stacked” (read: piled) rubble foundation that was falling down. All the timbers were poles cut from the forest and used with the bark still on, eated to hell by bugs and dry rot. He wanted to buy but I was able to talk him out of it.

Not as cold as Minnesota, but still cold.Looks like a lot of warm air i getting into the attic where the frost build up is. Usually frost is fairly even in a roof unless that is the only side that get no sun?https://builddaley.com/It doesn't look like a mold issue to me. But moisture does seem to be coming from the area immediately below. Is there a kitchen or bath below the frost? It may not be a huge leak (moist air) but having the moist areas of the house properly vented to the outside is best practice.

I have been in attics that look like Superman's Fortress of Solitude. Yours is very localized. Promote removing the existing insulation (it may be damp as well) and trying to get a vapor barrier down followed by a code meeting blanket of insulation. The vapor barrier might be difficult to achieve. In that case, be sure ceiling penetrations are sealed and suggest a vapor barrier paint on the ceilings for the high moisture rooms like the kitchen and baths.Above all, a good roofFixItFarmer said:

Gotcha. I tend to see frost buildup (granted, not this much) on the purlins and steel roofing on our barn from all the condensation. Maybe that's why it's where my brain went.Thank you everyone. Precisely the input I was looking for.

Yes I agree there is air leakage issue resulting in the frost. As well as when in thaws it could create water issues. This photo was taken in the morning, this was the only side of the attic with frost, and this side of the exterior would not have been getting much sun at the time. Though other attic sides also not getting much sun did not have sun either. 

The comment about a chimney and creosote is interesting. One because immediately to the right of this photo is the remnants of an old chimney; though it did go straight up. That said, I cannot figure out why a flat spot (dead center of the first photo) was framed at the peak of the roof. Neighboring houses built in the same area do not answer this either. This flat spot is dead center above the kitchen. The chimney would have went down and looks like it could have serviced the kitchen and or the living room.robh1 said:

few questions hope you guys can help me out with...trying to look out for myself. my dad who i work with, our wallets, tools and 2x trucks.. 

1 - Should we even cost it at all is it worth the risk? in my opinion i would say its not worth the risk (try telling my old school father to knock back work 🤯) 



Note he is planning on selling, does not care what the renovation looks like in the end. Red flag for low budget?

2 - if we do work it how do we cost it - do we allow time+$ for our laborer or security to watch our trucks all day? 
3 - any other ideas or things I should consider from your experiences? Odd question I know but there is a ton of good, experienced guys on here. 

I guess question 1 is invalid because we're going to have to work this one anyway - is there any safe ideas to help us go about it?

I might have read about it here. Can’t remember.

I own a building in what’s probably the roughest neighborhood in a 10 miles radius. I have left tools inside, never had any breakins or theft.

Don’t leave tools unsecured or in plain sight in your vehicle. Don’t leave doors open when you work. Don’t do anything outside that you could do inside. Setup a saw inside even if you’re doing exterior work, unless you can set it up right on the staging with you. If you can, cut in the basement, it is less noisy and won’t attract as much attention. Don’t listen to music, especially headphones when you work. Nod/wave/smile, maybe hello, to people that you come close to on the sidewalk or whatever, but otherwise mind your own business. Some people are easily instigated, even just thinking you’re being nosy by looking at them while they hang out on their front stoop could incite an unpleasant encounter.

Have a helper so you can maintain a gear watch while someone makes a coffee/supply run.

I’ve taken different tactics based on what is involved.
Outside I would ideally want a larger crew with a buddy system so no one is ever alone and an eye is on material and equipment at all times. Ability to lock anything inside if you even have to take your eyes away for a minute.
You’re not there to make friends, say hello but don’t get involved in conversation.
If an inside job I like to go inside and lock myself in. Try to only have what you need to take inside on the truck that day. During load in and out one person outside at all times watching the vehicle and tools.
Don’t forget to add in the pain in the butt cost.
In my experience most addicts are looking for the easiest no risk high. Being right next to the place that is helping them maybe a good thing because they don’t want to screw up there. 
Have a talk with the clinic and tell them what you will be doing, maybe they will have some suggestions.

$100-135 hrI live/work in the mountains of Montana where it can get cold and we get quite abit of snow. I frequently get called for damage done from ice damning and I run into alot of rotted soffits/fasica.

Prevention of the ice damning on what I will call a normal roof area is a discussion for itself, but my question today is I frequently see isolated areas of damage right where the dryer vent exits the house. All that hot and moist air directed onto the cold wooden surface(like under a eave), and it causes isolated melting of snow, that flows downhill but refreezes creating extensive ice damns. This past week I ran into an issue with a deck I was working on that Ive seen before too. The dryer vent exits under the deck and the first 4-6 feet of the joist bay is saturated with moisture causing wood deterioration on those isolated two joists. This deck surface is Trex, so the deck boards aren't particularly effected beyond surface issues.


Beyond rerouting the relocating the exit point of the vent, are there any solutions? Extending the vent to more clear space? Etc?I'm not aware of any practical solution other than routing the duct so that it exits the building in a location with plenty of free space, so the air has a chance to drop its moisture before hitting cold surfaces. Obviously, that's not always practical either--sometimes you just have to accept that condensation is going to happen, and go for a "least harm" solution.

Or use an indoor clothesline rather than the dryer in cold weather.Extend out from wall, & turn down away from joist. The result would be better dispersion of moisture away from damaged areas.Railman said:



Extend out from wall, & turn down away from joist.

Click to expand...

Using what type of material?Has to be smooth metal per code - looks like a wrong location also if that is actually a window thereSLS Construction & Building Solutions LLC Our Blog - The HTRCIt's from wet air combined with fine lint crusting on the surfaces. I agree with extending it and and routing it downward, along with the right louvered cap. Or line the joist landing area with something impervious. Maybe trim coil or 6 mil plastic.Why not try replacing the existing exhaust trim with an aluminum sidewall cap? Hot air will be directed downwards. Louver and pest screen will prevent air backflow/bugs. 









And SLSTech is right, that existing vent location as shown in the photo is almost certainly not code compliant.@SLSTech @Willievkatz 

You guys are spot on about the vent exiting within 3 feet of the window... I was so focused on the wood damage, that wasn't even on my radar! The distance from the dryer location in the house to this exit point is very far and inconvenient(gotta wonder why??). I'll look at relocating the exit next week with fresh eyes.

Hello, what state are you licensed in? contact me @ [email protected] and tell me what exactly you are needing, I can provide some guidance.Estimates are broken down in many ways. Now that we have computer power, estimates can easily be converted from one breakdown to others in no time.

When you say you are a general contractor. I would assume you do renovations or improvements. Typically, on situations like this you break things down in the order of Construction, as well as phases and customer selections.

a typical project would have: design, permits demo, framing, mechanical, electrical, plumbing and finishes. All these can be subdivided even more.

Another thing you need to be careful is to clasify things into technical formats like "master format" or "uniformat". These are all called Work Breakdown Structure or WBS.

"Master format" for instance clasify things more based on "what they are" , rather than when they take place during the construction. "Uniformat" is kind of the opposite and there are many more.

Some industries have standard WBS that you have to follow and some clients will actually tell you how they want things broken down and you only have to fill numbers on their forms.It's called a "Schedule of Progress Payments", on my contracts.


Mike.
___Mike.
_______________Something I forgot to add. 

Make sure your break down is horizontal (not many subdivisions or levels)

Make sure the breakdown is also good for scheduling and billing.

If you breakdown your work in 5 or 6 categories is easier to schedule those activities on a piece of paper as well as making schedule for progress payments.Break down only in big projects. Up to 30k lump sum . I do att items discretion but 1 priceGet a list of the Construction CSI codes and organize your estimates, proposals, etc. following their 16 division format.
It's really simple and makes sense once you start organizing things this way. Do google search and look it up.

The Magnum Siding Cutters are versatile, heavy-duty tools designed specifically for siding professionals. Save time and energy by cutting where you work without dust.

It works great for siding, haven't used it for flooring. 
Downside I could see for flooring would be it's pretty heavy to be moving around all the time.

If you were going to be doing alot of vinyl siding with it, you might want to consider the 26". 
The 20" will go down to a 6/12 gable cut with double 4" vinyl, but no lower. 


Sent from my SM-G965U1 using TapatalkEDIT: Much confusion arose from my making it sound like I wanted to put a sealing door so baths could still be taken. I want to turn this tub into a walk-in "shower" since it is only used as a shower with a wall mount for the shower wand. The issue is when owner is on crutches and cannot step over the tub.

Many approaches come to mind (abrasive/diamond disk and Sawzall) however the porcelain is "masonry" while the tub is "metal."

Not keen on grinding because managing the dust has issues - and while a Sawzall could make short work of the cast iron, I believe the porcelain would destroy the blade. (grind the porcelain off, then saw?)

NOTE: I know they make diamond blades for reinforced concrete but the ratio between masonry and metal is reversed with the tub.

Looking for suggestions.
Thanks in advance
Tom

MikeHaving a walk in tub may seem like a novel idea, until you realize you have to sit in a cold tub until the water finally fills up, after a nice hot bath you have to wait for the water to completely drain… doing all of this with a cast iron tub is completely insane!The Following User Says Thank You to Snobnd For This Useful Post: LeoWhy not just remove the cast iron tub and replace it with a tub made to be a walk in?623Carpenter said:

I agree.

Cutting the opening in the tub seems like the easy part. How about hinging the door, gasket, maintaining a water-tight seal, latching, etc.?I'm going to assume that this would only be used as a shower going forward? Although I agree that it is an unusual idea, I could see doing it if it makes it easier to step into and is strictly used as a shower going forward. There would be no need to hinge a door on it. Just leave about three inches of sidewall at the bottom and utilize a shower curtain.It's a thing.

Well, building area is given in terms of the product of length and width in a plane parallel to the plan view of the building.

Typically when people discuss costs/m^2 they are discussing building area, so see above.

If you wanted to know how much you’re making per square meter of wall, you could do that but it would be unusual, unless you’re a drywaller.

I’m not certain an area based profit or sales number for a single bathroom is useful for anything. I’d be looking at gross profit per unit time. Bathrooms have a lot going on and finishes can vary wildly. A fancy bathroom you sub out completely can have a big pricetag but your gross is small, yet you subbed it out so perhaps your cumulative time on site is small as well and so it was a good project.“If you need a machine and don't buy it, then you will ultimately find that you have paid for it and don't have it.”
- Henry FordSquare foot/meter price is useless as a guide for kitchens and remodels, as well as many other jobs.

We have one remodel which is essentially three bathrooms and a kitchen as scope in it right now.

All three bathrooms are wildly different. One a tiny refresh, one a full retile and new fixtures. One is a full add on, completely new.

How would either give me a number to use as a square price?

There's absolutely no logic in your question.Only if you demo them out?

The smaller the bathroom, the MORE it costs to remodel it BECAUSE of the lack of room......

Thus SMALLER baths always cost MORE per Meter/ square foot.....
Many times the tolerances are so tight, all old materials must be 100% removed to make room for new items....

Built in Bathtubs/ showers that require Heroic action to remove.

Make sure the ceiling height is standard, or a short room is EVEN MORE expensive to redo.

We apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused. This thread has been closed.Im changing out a 48" panel on a Frenchwood 8-0 slider operating door panel. I bought a replacement from Windowmama. The customer had another operating panel in the same room with good glass but delaminated exterior. The door I pulled was in great shape other than the broken glass and the other door had intact glass. The customer asked if could take the glass out of the delaminated door and reinstall into the broken glass door (hope you're following). Having the bad habit of not saying no.....anyway the glass is siliconed in and I need it flat to the glass razor knife to cut through the silicone and release the glass panel. I got the old glass out by using a taping knife and pounding it in between the glass and the wood frame (I scored as deep as I could with a Sheetrock knife first) Is there any knife tool I can get that I could use flat to the glass and cut the silicone, its about 3/4 deep? 
I dont want to keep driving the taping knife til I get all the way around. I afraid Ill flex the panel and it'll crack. Any help would be appreciated. I don't have pics...hope you can visualize. No scolding please....I should have known better.

I wonder if I could bend the blade so it would lay flat on the glass to get in between the sash and the glass. It would provide a good handle to pull down on.That knife will crack the thin door glass.

Running a flexible putty knife around won't, and it's easier than a drywall knife.

Now you have to decide on a course of action based on local conditions..This site is for professional contractors visit DIY Home Improvement ForumHello! 
We tore into a bathroom remodel today, planning to take out the subfloor and resheet it with advantech and put it back together.

What we found was 2x6 floor joists, one completely shot and many probably spanned too far. The house is an older house that has been added on to and remodeled a bunch of times and we're cleaning up the last guy's mess. All sorts of debris, waste and trash simply got left in the crawl.... 

My thoughts for putting it back together have us doubling the 2x6s simply to shore it up, hopefully forever. I do want to do it right and make it very stout. Can someone tell me the maximum span for a 2x6 and also if we're better off doubling them or running them closer together? 

Last, if we need to add supports, what is the best way to brace it from underneath? Presently, there's a sad setup with 2x4s bracing and supporting the apparently overspanned 2x6s.... our thought now is to go back with 6x6s resting on 4x8x16 solid blocks.... 

Sorry, I don't have any pictures to share! 

Thanks for your help!Well, in order to answer your question with any accuracy I would have to know the type of room (really) the amount of live load to consider and how many stories may be above it among other bit of info.

Then, if I was paid I could draw a plan for it and detail the spacing etc.

But generally speaking, somewhere in the neighborhood of 9' - 11', very much depending.


Andy.https://andytardif.wixsite.com/websiteUsing 6x6 for joists, or doubling 2x6, doesn't gain much strength. You need to increase the height.Based on the present layout - the house is old, it doesn't look like there's a good way to replace them with 2x8s or anything else. It looks like our only option is to rerun as 2x6s and add a few posts for support. I appreciate the posts and thanks for the info!You could get away with 9' span, though I wouldn't put tile on it. Sister the existing with LVL would be a better solution.
I'm assuming only one floor of load.I don’t think dimensional lumber is good for this at all. I’d be considering LVL or something of the sort.#22 said:

I'm don't buy what the engineer told you. Look at standard span tables, reduce the spacing and you can increase the span. The reason is that we're looking to keep the maximum deflection at 1/360th of the span. Adding members spreads that load over more joists. Rule of thumb is that joist depth can be reduced on size by doubling the width. Properly sistered joist act as a single member and should increase the distance they can span while maintaining the same amount of deflection.rrk said:

Click to expand...

Most of California. There are at least 2000 homes within twenty miles of me that were built in the last 15 years.A couple notes. Doubling or decreasing spacing does increase load carrying capacity. Code span charts go down to 12 inch spacing, IIRC. They don't have floor span charts for doubled joists, IIRC.

Choice of wood makes a difference, SYP and Doug for have longer allowed spans.

In this case, the first thing you do is check the charts for how it was built. If it met current prescriptive before being chopped up, then you're just dealing with repairs. Repair with the same dimension, or a little wider if possible

Bridging or blocking is often overlooked. It may not be required and it may not get you any more prescriptive span, but it can really stiffen up a floor and help load sharing between joists .

I asked a simple question.

You think that was an insult, you need a cry room and a box of Kleenex.

If you’ve built 60 homes, how is it that you don’t know where to find a span table?

How is it that you don’t know that piers and a 4x6 beam to split the span, is one of the most common details on first floor framing?

Theres absolutely nothing wrong with not knowing that, or being a homeowner looking for advice.

Forum rules are that we are not supposed to entertain DIY questions here. Therefore I ask unknown posters what their trade affiliation is.

If you think I do that to feel good about myself, perhaps that says more about you than me.

First step is consult inspector, imo.Had a client ask me to look at a closet floor that was collapsing, pulled up the plywood and found rotten joist sitting in the dirt, and an old open well in the middle that everything was falling into. About 20' deep at that time, with a few feet of water at the bottom. Filled it with concrete.Imo that's most certainly an extra regardless of what the solution is.

Seeing that it is already filled with rubble, I would think he would let you dig a footer in the backfill. Probably with a soils test. Never came across that situation, myself.Don't ask the inspector what to do. Ask if he has ever signed off on a solution to a similar problem. What was the solution that got the sign-off?You could ask a BI something like, I was thinking about "XXXXX to resolve this", "What will you be needing from me in order to proceed?"
The real question you do not want to ask is "Do I need a wet stamp to proceed?" If this deck is more than a couple feet above ground I can almost guaranty that he will want a wet stamp. I know they would here in FLAs 7D said fill it with slurry or shotcrete and my suggestion is then throw dirt on it until the BI signs off on it and build this thing.

I’m replacing a standard 30” door with a 12’ double sliding patio door on a single story enclosed porch. The existing header is a doubled 2 x 8. From what I’m reading that’s nowhere near enough to span 12’. Is there any way I can add to or modify the existing header to accommodate the increased span without removing the existing header?

But I've always thought, and done business as though, the maximum deposit a licensed contractor could charge a customer was $1k or 10%, whichever is less.

This doesn't look like a subcontract issue. Whoever signs the contract with the HO is the prime. 
OP has not explained how exactly this contractor "sells jobs in Costco". Who is the HO contracting with? Costco or the contractor? Or both? What are the terms of the contract? 

While CA law may or may not be violated and may or may not make sense, this particular deposit seems perfectly normal. Unless the cabinets are on the shelf at Costco, they are likely not returnable. The contractor can probably install them in one day. If the HO bails out the day before, he's stuck with the entire cost of installation.onmywayup said:

The theory is that you have working capitol. I don't take a deposit or down payment on any of my projects. On the rare occasion that I do a very small project, up to $10k, it's paid on completion.Actually you can take 100% as long as you have a bond to cover it. Companies like HD or Costco I'm sure are properly bonded.

And yes the 10% or 1000 only applies to home improvement contracts. Doesn't apply to new home builds or commercial.

The reality is that my actual cash out of pocket is very small. My material is on a thirty day cycle, payroll is a two week cycle. 
In CA the client has three days after signing the contract to cancel it (not in all cases). After that they have to pay you for whatever portion of the work that was performed, or you get to sell their property. It's time consuming, messy, and not something anyone wants to go through, but the system is there should you run across a crook.Pounder said:

That's incorrect in California. First off, as long as the cabinets were ordered after the three day right to cancel, the contract is enforceable and the client will end up paying for the cabinets and reasonable legal fees if I'm forced to take action for payment. The contract can't be canceled three weeks later unless both parties agree and I'm paid for what's been done. Secondly, I can bill for the amount I have to pay out the day I sign the cabinet contract. Third, I can indeed lien for things that weren't installed. I can lien to recover any job related cost I incur.
The reality is that I would allow any client to cancel a project at any time as long as my costs including P&O on those costs were paid. I don't have any desire to work for someone that doesn't want me doing their job.Pounder said:

It's a lien. The collection comes when you auction off their property, or they try to sell it.
The point here is that there are protections for the contractor in place. If you write a tight contract and follow the law, you will collect.Pounder said:

That's the key. If CA law allows you to do that, then it's no different than taking an unlimited deposit. Seems strange if the law is designed to protect the consumer. You could order cabinets, bill the HO, then cancel the cabinet order the next day and disappear with the HO's money. If the law allows that, it's very poorly designed.

I would run that by a construction and liens lawyer. CA language is pretty much the same as ours:
The foreclosure action will seek a sale of your property in order to pay for unpaid labor, materials, or improvements provided to your property. Our courts have interpreted that literally. "Provided to your property" means it was made part of the property, i.e. permanently installed. A load of lumber delivered to the property, for example, does not qualify because you can take it back without diminishing the property value.Quick question - I am remodeling a kitchen and am attempting to match drawers.

Made out to be crooks and liars. Common knowledge I thought.William
Wake Forest, NCInsurance claim jobs are very profitable providing you know what you are doing. The adjuster is going to divide the scope into two parts. The first is mitigation and the second is restoration. The mitigation portion of the job should give you approximately 80 to 85 percent gross profit. The restoration portion of the work should give you about 60% gross profit. Gross profit is what is left after you pay everything on the project. So if mitigation is $ 5,000.00 you should have a job cost of about $ 1,000.00 and if restoration is $ 10,000.00, you should have a job cost of about $ 4,000.00.

I would not give the adjuster a price. I would wait for him or her to give you a copy of their scope. The scope will be created by an estimating program called Xactimate. Once you have a copy of the scope, go over it carefully. Find every little detail not included and submit a supplement for the line items missing in the adjusters scope. I advise you contact a contractor in your area that know how to deal with the insurance company. Ask him or her to walk you through the process. If you have to pay him 10% or 20% of the final scope for there guidance, it will be well worth it. You will learn a great deal and most likely will make more money on the job because he will know how to price it. You will learn a wealth of information that will make you a great deal of money in the future.

The key is finding a contractor that is willing to teach you. They are out there.

The average mitigation and or restoration company that knows what they are doing does very well. Look around. they are the companies with the new trucks driving around. 

Stay away from the franchises such as Paul Davis and Serve Pro. They have contracts with the carriers and will not be of any help. Try and find independent mitigation or restoration companies. Those owners will usually be willing to teach you providing you are honest and reputable. 

Good Luck.

Never had to deal with an insurance company before

Click to expand...

And normally you never should. Perhaps insurance regulations vary with the state. Or perhaps insurance companies have different policies. 

In all insurance cases I ever dealt with, the insurance company does their own estimate and makes a settlement offer to the HO. They do not recommend a contractor, let alone pick one or deal with one. Some owners will have a contractor quote the work and/or advise them, but they (the HO) ultimately negotiate with their insurance company. 
And yes, the insurance estimates are done with Xactimate or its equivalents, which is software designed to minimize claims cost. So they are always very low.The biggest thing to keep in mind is that insurance companies adjusters job is primarily to keep as much money of the premiums paid as possible not giving it up... there's a reason insurance companies have really nice buildings, etc. it's because their job is to pay out as little as they can to a certain portion of their customers (why do you think they tend to drop people who make more than one claim)... add to it, an adjuster routinely misses lots of items on a claim, whether intentional taking advantage of the ignorance of the HO or inexperience, or both...

Just an example... One of our kids had a tree fall on their house... the adjuster came in and did his "assessment" and printed a check in his car for a little over $10K... it's their opening offer, and that's all it is and open ended, but I knew it was BS before even looking at the printout... When I did, literally stupid stuff, like $8 for paint and spackle for a crack in the walls on both sides of a large window, not noting that there's a REASON there's a crack on both sides and would have to be opened to find the cause... the adjuster didn't even go into the attic where trusses had been damaged... 

End result, after actually having contractors out (with guidance), along with a structural engineer to do the actual assessment of the damages and the final check for the repairs was over 4X the amount of the original "assessment"...

And then they try to say what they think the contractors profit margin is... it's why you treat them no different than any other client...KAP said:



(why do you think they tend to drop people who make more than one claim)

Click to expand...

Correction. People who make their first claim in 30 years get dropped.I've used exactimate before. It's been a long time, but I remember it being pretty accurate but everything is broken out so granularly it might look like the scope is there, but it's not. You might see 20sq of asphalt shingle at a ridiculous low price. But the dude didn't enter in underlayment, ridge cap, ice/water, etc and those things bring it up closer to where it's not so stupid. Things a roofer probably includes on the "20 square shingles" line. Still go by your own price though regardless.The few insurance jobs I've were very profitable, though it's been many years since the last one.Mold is a touchy subject for a lot of people. Some mold is toxic and on rare occasions can kill people with susceptibility to the toxins in dangerous molds. There are mold remediation companies that make their living stressing the importance of testing all mold found and using hazmat techniques to remove any and all mold. This leads to a lot of the information being blurred, from erring on the side of caution, to being downright paranoid about it and a lot of misinformation being spread on the subject.

Side Note: One HO told me that I should use only Kilz because they heard that it molecularly bonds with mold unlike any other primer or paint (where do they get this stuff?)

Now I do a lot of bathrooms, and 90% of the time with the old 4" tile over sheetrock method, water has gotten through and caused mold growth. Homeowners always tend to have a mini freakout about the presence of mold, however I usually try to calm them down. I tell them:

1. If you're concerned, you can order a test and either pay big money for fast results or wait 2 weeks for a test kit's results to come in. They rarely if ever request a test.

2. The vast majority of mold in homes is not the toxic super deadly kind that you hear horror stories about. Mold is like dust, it's pretty much everywhere and there's no stopping it blowing in through your doors and windows. It is also all over the material your home was built with, and it only grows when water comes into contact with it.

3. We can clean the studs with a bleach solution and then seal the wood with a little spray kilz.

Now I've done #3 on all of my jobs, but I was wondering if that's even necessary? It just feels like a "feel-good" measure and that there's really no way to get 100% of the mold seeing as how it just blows into the house every time you open the door no matter what you do. Mold is everywhere. It was on the wood the day the house was built, and when the water got to it, it started to grow.

And since mold goes dormant when no moisture is present, and using the materials we use today (Denshield + sealant on all joints and screwheads) and urethane grout should ensure that the space remains dry for the next 30-50 years. No moisture = no new growth and no significant release of spores seeing as how it's sealed behind a waterproof shower enclosure / subfloor + flooring.

So my question is this: in your opinions is it really necessary to bleach the mold and/or seal it with an oil-based primer before going back with the new materials? I know it can't hurt to seal it up, but is it necessary?Not sure if it's necessary but I have read multiple times as well as had a remediation company tell me that bleach isn't the best choice for killing mold. It works ok but there are better, less offensive products out there. Tea tree oil is one I have heard of as well as vinegar. I think we are trained that bleach smells like "clean" so that's what is the go to product when you see mold/mildew.It is what it is...now fix it.:whistlingYeah. I just always figured that mold spores are going to remain no matter what I use. Even if I treat all of the exposed wood, I'll be bringing spores in with me unless I hermetically seal the room.

I understand that there is some seriously dangerous mold out there, and if it's discovered, then a remediation company is the right call, but I also get the feeling that some of the advice from remediation companies could be biased to get them the work on harmless mold too.

Kind of like a lot of remodelers will push more expensive products on customers when they don't want it just to make more money. The contractor will be biased to try and give them the best, like any salesmen trying to upsell.I've heard lots of mold remediation companies say that bleach won't kill mold and a google search usually shows more of the same. Personally, I don't know of anything that bleach won't kill. In customers homes I will use bleach for a small area although I prefer to use hydrogen peroxide or vinegar in my house as it's less toxic.

I will usually do two, separate, 15 minute soakings with a bleach and water solution.

I have done a lot of mold remediation on jobs in the past. From the research I have done bleach isn't the best product for mold. I was refered to www.jondon.com by fellow contractor. If you take a look in the chemical section, there are a lot of anti microbial mold and bacteria treatments that are reasonabally priced. I hope that helps you out!And I want to add that all the products I install are not susceptible to mold with the exception of mastic, however I only use mastic on areas that are not subject to an abundance of water such as a kitchen backsplash. I also use urethane grout which is waterproof (or at least enough to keep the mastic dry on a backsplash anyways)I don't think I've ever hear that bleach won't kill mold, but that when bleach touches mold, the spores will release (like a reaction). This releases the mold pollen?? into the air for you to breath, which in turn can make you sick.

I know they make a spray that can kill mold and cover it up. Can't remember what its called. I saw it at a home show one time.Cool, lets put some fabric over a window and let a hurricane throw some stuff at it. I'm sure it will protect you and your windows.

http://www.gulfbreezewindows.comI think its called kills.http://www.kilz.comI use oxyclean for killing the mold on interiors, and creating a barrier to mold growth. Typically, it's a scrub, then fog (0.5% solution, and don't get it in your eyes. Foggers can be rented at Homedepot, etc)). It isn't as noxious as bleach. I do encapsulation (a good idea, but not always necessary) with Zinsser Shieldz. Kilz isn't very good for encapsulation, but it is cheap.Mold / Kilz

There is a time and place for serious mold abatement, but unfortunately it usually has to be your call. I've found a good third party testing that charges me about three hundred dollars to do two air checks. On a bathroom remodel I probably would not worry about it unless it was severe.

I was working on homes that had been vacant for a while and those ones made me nervous. 


I went to school with a girl whose family had black mold in their home. They has to move out for months. They had spores growing in their nasal cavity and have to go every so many months to the doctor and have the spores removed.Jakedpenaecc said:

Too late this was 9 years ago.How important is the brand of kitchen cabinets to your customers? Or how important is it that it be a national brand at all?

Every once in a while a homeowner focuses on a particular national brand of cabinets, and I work through one of the local dealers, when they could have better quality, more flexibility, quicker completion, and often a lower price, if they chose a local, custom, cabinet maker. I'll talk with them about the limitations of warranty programs, about the various benefits of working with a local cabinet maker, but they stick to XYZ brand of cabinets.

They've never heard of XYZ until days before, when they either saw the brand on-line, or upon visiting a showroom.

Anyone else run into this? Consider it a challenge? An opportunity? Any thoughts?- BobFor me I just send them to my lumberyard that at has a showroom & a designer. I don't wish to try to profit from the design time. Let the specialist do the leg work & educate the clients. 
In fact the more stuff I do, the more often I will hand off this end of the work. I do it with mechanicals too. 

Good luck BobI learned years ago that the biggest part of selling a job is educating the customer on things like this.
Works out for both of us.The better the product the easier the install and no call backs.IKEA is big this last year down in Dallas. Especially that really special 3D laminate laughing: :whistling RTF :blink Cabinetry

One example they sell doors, pre-sized. I can provide and install, RTF  I mean 3D laminate jester::clap doors that match their openings, Advantage- Not Ikea


Generally by me - National brand is something from Home Depot for the right price customers. They schard in thier shorts on price of custom cabs or even the semi custom type. Hard to get a win im my column there.Jaja Wazak always said nothing good ever come from CanadaIt's similar to the old business adage "No one ever got fired for buying IBM".

Name dropping the right brands to all their friends gets guaranteed "ooh's and ahh's, or at least limits blank stares. Folks like us are more aware of craffsmanship, features, etc., while most are happy with some soft-close doors and a brand name that assures them they made a good purchase.

The other day I bought a replacement clothes washing machine for an elderly client's rental home. I could have bought an LG on sale, but chose a more expensive Whirlpool model specifically because I figured the owner would feel more comfortable and be less likely to question the purchase.I can't remember the last new build or remodel I've worked on that didn't have custom cabinets from a local builder.We have limited cabinet builders here in my area and they aren't really know for the best quality and service and rarely keep to their original delivery date. Plus being in Cali we can't use the good finishing products like the big guys. For that reason I typically direct my customers to Kraftmaid from our Home Depot who has an excellent designer. Plus, they aren't much more than the local cabinet shops. 

We inherited a kitchen remodel gone south a while back and the customer had gone through one of the local shops before we took over. I think the original delivery schedule was 6 weeks from order. They wound up not delivering for 8 weeks past the original timeline! The customers asked about soft close hardware and they wanted $500/set! There was a whole slew of other issues as well and the install was one of the sorriest I have ever seen. That's why we do our own installs, but was out of our hands in this case. Now mind you, this is one of the bigger and "better" shops around here. I just can't do business this way and that's why I don't use the local shops.Not so much the brand, but the look of the cabinets. Most people will see a bunch of kitchen cabinet pics and choose based what they like.

A couple of people have asked me for Shaker kitchen cabinets, but most of the time, they do not include brand names.My Company Website: http://www.flatrateconstruction.netHere's the worst experience that I and my partner would like to share.

We had good experiences with these types of cabinets in the past. So, we didn't have any apprehensions or whatsoever. I guess we're immediately reeled in by what we saw on the website. It looked good and the specs were right. But lo and behold...we first tried to assemble the biggest cabinet which was for the over and there was no instruction manual. There were also numerous missing drawers in all the pieces. The oven cabinet that we ordered was supposed to have four drawers but then this only came with one. Now, how about that? What really bothered us was that instead of the company owning up to its mistakes. They started to point fingers. To cut this nightmare short, go for branded cabinets but please don't go the RTA route.lauriejustin said:

Agreed! But for other reasons. 99% of RTA cabinets come from China where there are zero regulations on pollutants. They are infested with lead, sulfur and formaldehyde in dangerous amounts. If they were made in America, they would have to abide by minimum pollutants but as an import, they are exempt. 

Additionally, there are many sizes and specialty products that are just not available. There are documented deaths due to Chinese wood flooring exposure (research Lumber Liquidators) where children get very sick, we one day will read about a death by Chinese cabinet exposure. We may not have to do any cutting on the ready made cabinet boxes but you surely do on the trim and you will breath in that nasty poison.If you don't push to be perfect in everything you do, then you will always remain just average.In my case lately i see how people is buying cabinets from ikea. i guess they have low prices and the design is beautiful but you can feel that the materials have a poor quality in so many aspects that sometimes cause some troubles for us installing heavy countertops in those cabinets.i'm a owner from a company Countertops in EdmontonHi.

Check out LF209. It's a Simpson face mount joist hanger 2-1/16" by 9-1/4". You also might be able to use an IUS 2.06/9.5. It for an engineered I joist, but the size is right and might work.​Just did this on a kitchen remodel. Use an ijoist hanger and fill in the void with osb or plywood. Or you could use any hanger that is wider than the joist. I make the osb 2 1/4 x 9 1/4. A double joist hanger 3'' with 1/2 '' on both sides would also work. Beats having to wait on a special order.2'' Joist hangers

I have had luck in using 2 1/2" hangers designed for TJI's and using ply-wood strips as fillers.When I was in Trinidad, I did notice that they not only used real 2" wood but also had hangers. I think you need to check for ways to purchase outside the US...negative guys, simpson makes this. not even a special order. Go to the lumber yard! It is the LF series. I use them all the timeAnthony

That's gotta stop. If you want to grow your business, work on it, not in it.One boss that writes bids, cuts checks and does sales/client relations. One foreman that does what you currently do ie project manage prepare for trades, adds finishing touches that pull everything together and executes work that would be cheaper, better, more efficient than a specialty trade. One grunt who does demo, helps foreman. Two or three of each specialty trade plumber, electric, sheetrock, framer, tile, carpet, hardwood, plaster, hvac or whatever relevant trades you use. The beauty of being a contractor is minimal FIXED COSTS. You use the trades to transfer the responsibility for specialty tools, skillsets to the smaller outfits while lowering and transferring risk exposure.Hey, we're remodeling a house and need to change the placement of the front door.

Around here that means Corian and its equivalents. Not clear if the wife's objection is to the tile form factor (i.e. more than one piece per wall with grout) or she specifically likes a plastic composite material. 
If the problem is the form factor, both ceramic and natural stone are available in very large format (one piece) as Big Johnson pointed above.Absolutely NO grout....

Thin porcelain slabs are becoming more and more popular but the expense can be high (comparitively) depending on the configuration and # of miters/transitions... It's typically handled by your stone fabricator/installer.

Personally, I've never been a fan of cultured marble or solid surface...they both scream "fake" and you can see it from across the room.

Quartz products have a higher end feel, and many offer patterns that mimic natural stone. Again, I'm not a fan of something man-made trying to look natural but they've come a long way in regard to pulling that off.

Most complaints about tile relate to grout. These are negated by using epoxy grout and/or ultra large format material.

This is a master shower we just finished. It was originally spec-ed in Dekton thin porcelain but the cost was prohibitive (based on our overall budget) due to all the cuts/transitions. We ended up using 2'x4' porcelain tiles with metal edging (and epoxy grout).Christopher Wright, CR: President @ WrightWorks, LLC

Any input would be appreciated.

ThanksThis doesn't answer your exact question but I put down nature stone and then put a large throw carpet over that. It worked out great. The nature stone lets the concrete breathe, and the carpet is elevated from the slab moisture.Also, if you do dri-core over an open drain, the P trap will dry up and start putting out sewer gas.You bother to check the date of the post you responded to????griz said:

No, it was at the top of the list.I'm removing a molded shower stall from a 3/4 bath and will be replacing it with a pan and 3/8" acrylic sheets. The yard where I purchased sheets said to install them over 1/2" backer board. My question is can I use mold/moisture resistance 1/2 drywall since it will be 100% covered by the acrylic? It would be much easier than to try to seam from the backer board to the drywall since I'll be replacing the entire wall. BTW, the acrylic will be installed full height to the ceiling.

back in the day that was very trendy, I did a few of those. If I remember right Corian sold those as a kitIts only a 36x36 space but i was concerned about getting a nice clean joint between the backer board and the short section of wall. My plan is to redo the short wall so if I can use a good wet/mold resistant drywall it will finish so much better. Besides this is a one day project so time is of the essence. Most of the joints will be covered in beadboard.

You should be ok with greenboard, thought some jurisdictions require a silicone backer such as denshield. doesnt hurt to put a membrane between the backer and panel... ie aquabar b. straightedge and a multitool works great for cutting the panel, eliminates the risk of blowing a big chunk out of it. used to run a circular saw blade backwards, works in a pinch, but not the best method.Here in Indianapolis, there's a charity event each year called the St. Margaret's Hospital Guild Decorators' Show House. They lease a home, typically older/historic, from the owners and divide the spaces among various interior designers to showcase their work. Most of the spaces are transformed by with paint, wall coverings, furnishings, etc. Some major spaces, like kitchens and baths, involve various levels of remodeling. I've worked on a number of these homes over the years for designers I do regular work for.

This elegant lady is 4160 Washington Boulevard in the Meridian-Kessler neighborhood. The brick and timbered Tudor Revival home was built in 1919, and served as the St. Margaret's Hospital Guild Decorators' Show House in 1980. For her Centennial, she was the show house again in 2019. My team and I renovated the kitchen for the designer Matt Harris.

The older photo was taken in 1925 (Bass Photo Co Collection, Indiana Historical Society.) The house has a fascinating history, which you can read more about here: https://www.showhouseindy.org/History-2019

It's a massive home--with, as was typical for the time, a very modestly sized kitchen. We combined a butler pantry and kitchen to create the new space you see here.

The cabinetry is quarter-sawn white oak, and styled to match details and built-ins original to the house. The counters are soapstone.

One of the tall pantry units is a false front, and conceals a chimney. Many a visitor to the show yanked and yanked on the false door's handle trying to get it open. 😆Christopher Wright, CR: President @ WrightWorks, LLC

The subject home contains 9,163 square feet, of which 8,438 square feet are in the two-and-half levels above ground. The remaining square footage is in the unfinished basement. The northern portion of the house was built on an angle to the southern portion of the house, creating an unusual appearance. The explanation for the home’s unique floor plan, handed down anecdotally over the years, is that there was a tree on the north side of the unimproved lot that the Mallerys did not want to cut down in order to build the house. The architects angled that wing towards the northwest, which allowed the tree to remain.

Yes. The designers do their work for gratis or at a reduced rate for the exposure. When the show is over they remove any interiors/furnishings they brought in...the owner has the option to buy it.

Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkI’m remodeling the rest of a bathroom that previously had a walk-in tub and surround installed by re-bath years ago.

They installed a floor “threshold” piece to cover the floor-tub junction and it looks like the same stuff is adhering the acrylic surround. I don’t think I’ve ever seen this adhesive before (there was a lot of adhesive, so maybe I’ve just never seen it applied this thick).

It’s white and has a very flexible, almost spongy feel, like really soft silicone. Given that it’s many years old, I was really surprised. It was obviously applied by a gun and clearly meant to go on thick. 

I want to try to use the same stuff to re-apply this threshold now that the new tile is in, but I’m not completely sure what it is. My first instinct was pl550, but I’ve never applied it this thick, so I’m not sure that’s it. 

I know there are various adhesive options I can use, I’m just hoping someone knows what I’m talking about and can point me in the right direction.You may want to investigate Component Bonder by Integra Adhesives.silka flex is rubbery .comes in white .very adhesive .could be something of that nature .Dap tile & tub is like that but I believe it’s acrylic.

Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkI think I’m gonna try some sikaflex. It seems pretty close to what I’m seeing. Thanks for the tips.I live in a historical district in Tampa, Florida. My home is on the historical registry. As of this moment, it has vinyl siding over the original, rotten wood slats. We wanted Hardiboard, but are not allowed. We are supposed to replace only the damaged wood - which will essentially be all of it, as it's all dry rot and termite eaten.

The real battle is the windows. Our builder originally ordered vinyl windows but he is not allowed to put them in. The city wants wood interior windows with impact glass. CRAZY, that they care about the interior. They haven't even seen the inside of my house. Right now it has aluminum frame windows throughout. Of course, there are many historical homes in the area with vinyl windows and Hardiboard siding, but they don't care about them when we bring them up.

So our builder brought us over 2 samples - Weathershield Premium and Windsor Pinnacle. They were charging us $30k for 20 windows. I am told these wood/aluminum windows will cost more. Let me get your opinions please.This site is for professional contractors and tradesmen.

We apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused. This thread has been closed.Anybody done a fully-mirrored wall w/ power and how would you address the following:  Wall-mount tv and associated receptacles and mount, wall sconces. Wall is about 9' wide x 7' high, and thinking about 3 panels. 

The sconces were mounted to a round plate (and then to box), but plate extends beyond sconces currently. When it goes onto a mirror, it will need to not have a plate extending beyond the sconce. How would you prepare for this, ahead of glass company meaurements, and also the tv mount? Wondering if I should omit mirror behind tv, or hae a separate cut rectangle (in case of potential cracking in future), but it's a room where wall is seen from the side as one walks in, and they want a clean look. Thoughts?Sounds like some drywall is going to have to come out to fix the sconce issue.
While you're there, make sure the TV mount has a sturdy backing....more drywall torn out.
Get the TV bracket and find out exactly where it needs to be placed.
If the glass people can cut out for the receptacles and sconces, they can cut out for the TV bracket."We'll be fine"Robie said:

Yup, blocking is in the plan (and moving one or both sconces). But would you mount a 42" tv on a mirror, even with the blocking? I suppose, but....

Keeping a small hole and mounting those sconces are another matter. Need the smallest mount possible, and not a mirrored round plate or anything like that (if it exists).

Edit: Maybe I'll modify the sconces to mount on a hickey, and install the bar before the glass is installed. Something like that.What's the mirror thickness? Is it tempered?

I wouldn't. But I would think a TV mount could be found with just one wall attachment point and have the mirror cut around that.
Just thinking about it, I don't think the sconces would concern me much unless they are big and heavy.

You would never mount the tv over the mirror. The mirror should always be cut out around the tv mount.
Think about the holes through the mirror for the mount, then consider putting pressure between those points when you bolt the mount to the wall.

So it seems, although a lot of places are still selling/advertising tempered mirrors.

From Wilson Glass....




Tempered mirrors, which were available at one time, are no longer produced by the mirror manufacturers that fabricate and supply products to WA Wilson It was found that the tempering process adversely changed the optical quality of the glass, causing distortion to occur in the reflected image mirror. Also, defects present in tempered mirrors due to the heating and cooling processes were easily viewed in the reflected surface. When they were produced, tempered mirrors never met the ASTM C1503 standard specification for silvered flat glass mirrors. This meant that physical defects, although objectionable, were not considered as a reason for rejection. 

WA Wilson is recommending annealed mirrors with safety backing for this project

Click to expand..."We'll be fine"Yeah. Annealed with safety backing sheets. They crack, but stay together.

That would drive me nuts to see myself.

Of course, I'm not a hot chick or a buff dude. Though, I am sexy. Still...

Also, I hate it when people put full length mirror behind a toilet.

Don't need to see that either.

I did once have mirrors removed at a customers new house, lots of them. Bedroom ceiling and walls, exercise room, and entire giant bathroom.

Condo neighbors had lots of stories.Think ballet school."We'll be fine"ok , i`ve done one old train caboose 

looking to do a second.
first one we did , the sandblaster didn`t speak English ( was part of the welders job), did an o.k job , and gave me no input then we primed , and then the welder came 

this time , different welder and sandblaster 
sandblaster said " do the welding first , , then we come and sandblast , and prime as we go right away.( because raw metal will rust right away if you let it set till the welder is done ) if we come first , and prime , the welder will have to burn off the primer .

this is an approx. 90 foot long train car . sandblasting a priming will take 4-6 days

just wanting any input if anyone can tell me .
is this sandblaster correct?Sounds correct to me."We'll be fine"Makes sense to me, but I am not a welder.Do the welding. Don't worry about priming the welds, the sand blaster will take care of any surface rust.

Prime as soon as possible after sandblasting. In some locations the same day may be necessary. Epoxy primer would be your best bet.

I wonder if anyone can help me

I’m working on a house in japan built in the 70s
Wood frame, 4” walls with fiberglass batt insulation, red cedar wood siding.

the weird thing is the whole house has a under layer of sheet metal instead of house wrap or asphalt under the siding


has anyone seen this practice before?

Is this a heavy snow area thing?

do I rip off the metal or leave it when I replace the siding ?? Or put house wrap over it??Sheet metal has a good shear rating and Japan is very active seismically so keep that in mind.It was installed for a reason

MikeWould be interesting to see pictures. Advantages if thick enough would be resistance to penetration by wind blown objects during a storm, shear strength, act as a faraday cage to limit electric signals, slow cutting through for theft protection, vapor barrier if well sealed, slow some particles in case of nuclear accident, some degree of fire protection, if well grounded act as a path for electricity (lightning) to ground. This is probably of no help but was interesting to think about.

MikeLooks like a home made double bracket, not factory made. No load rating is looking for trouble. To me it looks like the load path will squeeze the upper pipe and put a beyond spec load onto all connections, including pull through of screws on the strapping and probably the ceiling connector.

Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkI usually don’t consider keeping the tub surround as part of a bathroom remodel, but I have one coming up where it’s just highly impractical to replace. It’s a tile pattern molded fiberglass unit in good condition, but it’s just an ugly color. 

The homeowner could live with it, but would prefer it to be white. Does anyone have experience or advice on refinishing fiberglass surrounds? Have you done it or had it done for a client? What’s the durability like? What finish systems should I be looking for? It seems like epoxy or gel coat would be the obvious options. I’m handy with my HVLP sprayer, but this feels like something I should sub out to a refinishing company.Prepping a raised tile surface sounds awful. I'd let them hire a fiberglass refinisher separately so they can deal with potential finish issues directly. I'll bet the $1000 bid or whatever it is to refinish would make replacement or keeping it "as is" the better options.I've done a few acrylics and a few fiberglass ones using the spray can coatings at big boxes. The fiberglass coating is different from the acrylic.

Materials cost to do it is around $45 per kit, and I get 2 kits before starting.

From there, it's all preparation and how good you are with a spray can. Mine turn out great.

I couldn't say how long one going over a different color would seem to last, or how many coats would be needed for hiding the original color. The coating appears the same after 10 or so years going white over white, it doesn't seem to chip or delaminate.FWIW, fiberglass uses a gel coat system. Spray can coating the surround is not terribly difficult. If you know someone who does this on things like fiberglass boat hulls, they should have no problems.I did a harvest gold surround for an in-law. Used the two part epoxy brush on stuff. It worked alright. The fumes were killing me even though I was wearing a respirator, had to rush at the end and ended up with a few runs. The stuff covered and seems to be holding up, though it's only been a few months.Framing a basement bedroom walk-in closet, removing the insulation squares that hid the rim joists (remainder of ceiling is uninsulated), I discovered that the sistered joists that go onto support the exterior deck were run in 'open fashion'.

On this covered triangular extension, under the OSB decking, faced insulation was placed. Pull the insulation and you can see the light of day coming through the vented vinyl soffit below.

Interior floor is hardwood (while triangle runs a 9 ft distance along house having two 6 ft sides forming outermost wall).

I'm thinking these open bays must blocked off, to keep out vermin and pests and, for separating home's envelope.
Although there are no floor vents in this bump out. And the floor already chills in the winter which may gain some heat that seeps through from the the main area.

Bees had been coming into the basement. And pulling the insulation there are signs of old bird nests, some deposits.


Normally I shoot Loctite Tite Foam that's supposed to handle pests - but I've no idea about carpenter bees?
Despite the cold floor issue, shouldn't these type areas always be blocked? Probably caulked though I rarely see it.Usualy they blocked regardless with 2x. In some cases, depending on the sub-frame design they used open joist construction, and most likely this what you have if it was originally designed that way... If not they just never provided blocking.I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​The rim joist, and blocking between joists, is to provide lateral support for joists. You should at the very least have solid blocking between these joists at the foundation. That will do a lot more to keep the vermin out than any insulation or spray foam.While we've not had any vermin, I'd like to not see it in the future.

Main squared-off section is blocked by the continuous rim joist (referring to deck opposite). It is mainly the angle adjoining this that is open.

I'm looking for something besides 2x that can be placed and I'd like to think it's non-structural. Although I don't want any walking sounds set off either by something weaker.

Something the bees don't like (won't bore). I doubt that treated is needed since the exterior is covered and not exposed to elements except for eve vent updrafts.This is how cantilevers are usualy built.

Insulating rim joist with spray foam or XPS and spray foam combination
Delta membrane on all perimeter walls and floors
XPS foam for walls 2-3” (all seams sealed with blue Tuck Tape)
2x4 framed walls with 1” air gap between XPS and framing 
Roxul insulation in framed cavity
1” XPS over Delta on the floor (all seams sealed with blue Tuck Tape)
5/8” OSB over XPS for sub floor. 

Also considering tying the delta from the walls into the delta on the floor by running the wall delta under the perimeter of the floor by approximately 6” to create a continuous air barrier between the top of the foundation walls and the floor. 

Also for areas of the basement which will be unfinished, any recommendations on how / if to terminate/ seal the delta on the floor in those areas or should I just allow those areas to be open to the edge of the delta?I assume by Delta you are talking about a dimpled drainage mat...

Thanks for the reply.

Correct on the delta material and the floor before wall framing. There is a sump and drainage already in place. Home is ~ 25 years old. Drainage in window wells, and along footing.

I was wondering how to seal the top of the delta as well. Not sure on that one yet. The only effective option I could think of at this point was the same foam used for sealing the rim joist (used on the top of the delta and sealing it to the concrete).

agree on the 3/4” T&G v. 5/8. 

I need to review with the building inspector to see if they will pass without poly VB. Seems that many municipalities are a little behind the current science on VB in areas like basements

It does cost more, but save a lot of time, and works flawlessly. The time it takes to form footers is always a concern. I never liked the black perforated flimsy drain pipes either, they get smashed and clogged, and never flow correctly. This helps with Radon also.650cc on the track
800cc on the snow 1000cc on the streetI have used Form A Drain for many years. It is an excellent product.I have a project to replace an island which has the sink in it. My stone fabricator is 2-3 weeks out right now from template to install. Though he said he could be a week out by the time I want to start this. What would you do in the interim to be able to have a half-way functioning kitchen while the top is being made? I am using his 2-3 weeks as the worst case scenario. What are the options? Thanks in advance.Depends on your definition of "half-way functioning". In my own house, I'd just slap a sheet of plywood on it.That's what I do as well for a temporary top. I was referring more to not having a sink. So, the lack of a sink will be just an inconvenience during the project? I've only done partial kitchens, so the sink downtime is usually a day or two.I guess I should have expanded on that. Plywood is cheap and easy enough to work with that you can just chop a hole in it and install the sink temporarily. It really doesn't take all that long, and the plumbing will be in place for when the real top arrives.

Just depends on how happy you need to keep your client.If you can rely on your k-top guy I’d say 2-3 weeks out is great as here I’m looking @ at least a month. Availability @ that. You can set up the sink temp in the existing island as Tin mentioned. Pull sink, cut ply to fit cabs/sink hook sink up & secure until top arrives

That would be a cheaper alternative than a sheet of plywood.I remove the old kitchen but I save the countertop with the old sink installed and then just cut and set aside until the new cabinets are in and install the old sink and countertop piece, saves me a lot of time and the customer a lot of headaches!The Following User Says Thank You to Snobnd For This Useful Post: LeoThat would make it a bit easier than making a sink cut out and reinstalling. The island footprint will be quite different, so the top will not even be close to the new but the sink with that part of the top should work to put into the sink cab. I will still need some sort of sheet for the rest.

Drywall gets tossed
Sink gets reused on the next kitchenWe are starting to get quite a few people interested in Japanese baths, anybody have any info on these other than the toilet has to be far away from the shower/tub.
ThanksThe only thing I recall about them is the small, deep tub with scalding hot water. Apparently everyone uses the same water, so you shower first. Your gonads shrink up when you get in and if you move in the water it gets worse. It is quite refreshing. Don't see a lot of use of it during the summer months however.Japanese baths are totally different than American baths. Japanese take a bath every night before they sleep. The shower and bathtub of the majority of Japanese bathrooms (probably 99%) are in the same room but are separated. The shower is on the outside of the bathtub. 

















The bath tub is not for cleaning. It is for warming up the body and relaxation. ​








Before entering the bathtub, washing the body is the rule. Shampooing of the hair can be after or before entering the tub. Why is washing before entering the tub important you might ask? It is because each member of the family uses the same water. The water is changed only once each day. The purpose of the bath is to relax and warm the body, NOT to wash. It is not proper to bring the face cloth or any other towel into the bathtub. Since everyone uses the same water, keeping the water clean is expected. 
In traditional Japanese homes there is a decided order for bath taking. Usually the Father takes his bath first, if he comes home late then this order will obviously be different. In most homes the last person to enter take a bath is responsible for draining the water and wiping down the tub. However, in some homes the tub water is used the next day for laundry. A hose is use to siphon the water into the washing machine. Why not, the water is clean. If you have the opportunity to be a guest in a Japanese home, at some point you will be politely asked to take a bath. Don't refuse the offer. You may want to be kind and let someone else go first, but this innocent gesture of kindness could create an awkward situation. :sad:

A lot of modern baths here in the states have a shower and a tub/whirlpool. The "bath house" is a small oasis... shower, tub, sitting area. The toilet and sink area is tougher. Some want the toilet in a little room with a small wash sink and another area with the sink and dressing area. Some just want a knee wall hiding the toilet. 

Takes a lot of space for one of these deals. As you can imagine, careful planning with the HO is needed. 

DaveI never  give up!The one I was in wasn't much more than 24x24 and deep. I think it had a seat in it. The one in the photo looks like a western bathtub.cleveman said:

I agree that it is a western style (and an ugly one with tile on the face)... many, many shapes exist depending on year, budget, and preferance.

My believe is the HO will have a definate idea what is desired and the trick will be filling their order!I never  give up!Totally off topic but I remember the old soap commercial with all of the little kids lined up in the loooong tub and washing each other's backs.

Then one kid passed gas. Very funny ad.You can't solve you're problems with the same level of thinking that created the problems. 

Albert EinsteinI'm fine with showering. If I need to relax I'll buy a hot tub.

Oh and I don't care how clean you are, if you try to wash my clothes in water that has contacted someone else's bunghole I don't want no part of it!I lived in Japan for 4 years and I can tell you this about the baths, I could not wait to get back to the States to take a good bath........

Clifton, Great Falls, McLean, Fairfax Station, Manassas, Virginia Renovation ContractorJapanese tubs (ofuro) are generally designed differently- tall with a small opening generally- built so you can get your entire body in without having your knees sticking out. The shape is also better for retaining heat.

They traditionally were made of wood- Wood is somewhat better as an insulator than stone. Easier to make, too.

A friend built a Japanese style bath- he ran hydronic heating through the floor. And a concrete ofuro- with hydronic heating through it. Pretty nice touch I thought.

There are a number of Ofuro makers here in the states. Most build them from Port Orford Cedar or something close.We built this Japanese style soak tub for a "his" master bath renovation. It was a PITA and I would recommend finding a pre-built solution.

~ One sink in room 1, one sink in room 2. Toilet in room 1.

~ Each room needs to be separated

Apparently it is part of the culture for a family to bathe (sp?) and shower together, however, the toilet is unclean and should be far away.

Indianapolis Kitchen Remodeling Contractor - Master of the Home FeatureThis is fascinating! I have not seen this before. I second the motion for pics.I am doing some research to build my own Japanese bath (they call it a "unit bath system") in the US too. Namely, they have this ready-to-assemble bathroom which comes with lighting, exhaust fan, tub, tilings, and all (and you can customize what to add, too!). What sucks, however, is that they only sell this sort of product domestically, and not globally. C'mon TOTO 

Here are some pictures of unit bath systems.I'm a new builder in Michigan and I had a question about blower door tests. I know that additions must meet the energy code but unaltered portions generally do not. Are blower door tests then required on additions?

Thanks for the responses. I'm in the Detroit area.

I'd be surprised if they make you do one unless it's a very picky inspector. 

Ori 

LocalEnergyAudits.comOut here, additions have to meet the code for air tightness. You have to get a test before you start demo to establish a baseline for the existing building and another test when the project is done. From there you use the square footage of the existing and the addition to calculate how tight the addition is. 

If you fail to get a test before demo, you have bring the entire combined test result up to code.Hi Denver All I can say is wow that's would be incredibly difficult to get the whole buildings' thermal envelope up to code just for a addition and from experience I can tell you that unless it's a newly constructed and up to standards it will most definitely fail a blower door test. Here they are enforcing new residential dwellings only and they barely make it. I can't imagine having to get an old house to these 2015 IECC standard. You'd have to break all the drywall up!

If you look closely, you'll be able to see where the individual wood laths are.Ah yes. Thermal Bridging is the term I learned to explain this phenomenon, but goes by lotsa names. Sometimes really noticeable on ceilings as well. Soot of all kinds will show the sins.Troy Stevens, Stelzer Painting Inc.
www.stelzerpainting.comI was at a house today with a 2 story living room and a wood stove, you could see every stud and the rim joist very clearlyThis is a southern exposure wall, which I think is why you don't see framing more clearly. It gets heated up, and the studs may cool slower than the rest. Just a guess on my part. Definitely a better r value for studs than plain old air, though.

I'm guessing this house was blown with cellulose 50 years ago. They didn't do dense pack back then, so settling is common, as are voids from the original retrofit.

You don't see this much down south AFAIK.how do builders not insulate around windows. In gaps can see daylight. Flashing outside isn't right. Suppose there's no tape either.

Good for business, but embarrassing at same time.Low bid...this looks like a 70 or older house .if so it was not commonly done . looks like 2x4 walls with poorly placed bats .Lots of aluminum windows done that way. Jambs are preattached at the factory with clips. 

Never seen one with any kind of insulation. Always uninsulated.

I like doing those replacements. Quick pop at the clips with a 5 in 1 and they are free. Cut back with multitool and install new window. Don't even have to mess with interior trim.

Insulation would make it messy. 

Sent from my SM-N975U using TapatalkThere are many many houses built that way, many built in the 60s with 1" fiberglass or a sheet of foil backed paper.

I hope you have disclaimers for this type of thing in your contract and you can write change orders.I am a “Crawl Space Encapsulator” and I hope to find and easier way to physically measure the outside perimeter of a homes foundation on either a device or an app downloadable on my IPhone or iPad. I encounter so many variations and challenges from one project to the next measuring the outside perimeter of foundation, trees and shrubs, landscape features and other obstructions such as garbage can enclosures that make accurate corner to corner measurements difficult. I envision a tool where I start at a designated start corner and with a laser device I click a starting point then drag to the next and so on until I return back to the designated start corner, then measuring is complete. Storage capacity of each project is needed and the ability to download and print, the ability to save to file on my iPad for future reference. I found a few apps online and I did not care for all the bells and whistles they contained, I need a basic program that depicts a foundation wall from a plan view, the corner to corner dimensions and possibly a square footage calculation. I look forward to hearing everyone’s feedback, thanks MikeSometimes the easier solution is better.

Hey Wallmax, nice to hear from you and your suggestion, I need accuracy.

Hello Ed, Crawlspace encapsulation is a process of fabricating a shield made from commercial grade rolled vinyl to prevent excessive moisture/humidity within crawl space so to prevent mold and mildew turn light damage and excessive moisture within structural wood components and which within years turns to failure of your floor system. A more simplified explanation is, it is a reverse swimming pool liner the difference being, it is designed to keep water out of the inside of the swimming pool liner. And the accuracy is more important for the preconstruction preparations we do in our shop with pre-cutting the ground liner pieces and stack them in a preplanned organized manner so to Facilitate the simplicity and expediency of installing the ground liner. Keep in mind most crawlspaces are between 16 and 24 inches head height and very difficult place to cut and roll long lengths of material underneath the house, we invest this time so two best ensure the quality and efficiency of our install.Why do it from the outside? A laser from the inside seems like the most accurate. You need to get down there eventuallyThey make roof software to measure roofs. Maybe the software company has something for footprints.

I would still want an explanation as to what failed for the wall to move like that. That is the condition that needs fixing...:thumbsup:I would guess that the tree damage split the plate and studs right in line with where the ceiling joists were toe nailed in. Without the ceiling joist to prevent it from drifting out, that is exactly where it wants to go. The weight of the roof and friction of the nails is resisting your attempts to pull it back in. Might have to completely remove that top plate, clear any nail or wood fragments, reinsert a new top plate, and pull the wall in. Simpson does make some hangers that would go around the joists and onto the wall to make the connection secure.Thanks guys. I'm looking at Simpson's website nowI'm thinking that if you can lift the roof weight off of the wall ,you might be able to use a come-along to pull the wall back in, and use the appropriate ties to make it stay.

Get the thing stabilized first, so it doesn't just flop apart. And don't run any big machines into it, unless you want to be on the 5-oclock news. Find all the obvious sticking parts and clean up with sawzall. Pull it together with plates and threaded rod - which is way more forceful than a come-along, and much less susceptible to scary lurches. Crank on some tension. The sticking points are easy to find - they're the places with a solid thunk when you hit them with a sledge. Deal with the sticking points one by one, with sawzall or a sledge. Crank on more tension. Rinse and repeat. That looks like sunlight through the planks, so you can smack it?

A screw jack might help if a joist has dropped.

I was standing outside the building I worked on after fixing it, bragging to anyone who would listen, and relating all the gossip about the drunkard who had done it, when the guy I was talking to got a funny pained look on his face and said that he had done it and that he wasn't drunk, he'd simply hit the gas instead of the brake.

Anyway, I say slow and easy - no running big machines into it.- BobThanks sfo

Maybe 5 or 6. We had a pile of long all-thread - 8 & 10 footers, holddowns and washers and nuts in inventory, so we just grabbed them all. We had to drag the bottom plate in in a few spots, too. We also had some header material - 4x10 I suppose - that we used to pull sections in.

I'm really slow and careful about this sort of thing. I saw a building come down on my dad when I was a teenager. He lived, but it was a close thing for a while.- Bobjlsconstruction said:

Should have gotten back to this sooner. I see SFO has covered practically everything. I wouldn't cut out the top plate until I have stabilized it all, figured out exactly how I was going to pull it together, and done as much prep as possible. 

If you use cables / comealongs, put tension and then sledge from the outside - if you try to do the full pull with the cable, cable stretch makes it slide further than you may expect when it starts moving. Tension then sledge - if it doesn't move, put some more tension on it, sledge again. Being slow and careful can go a long way to saving the structure and your butt.

Using threaded rod, you can leave everything in place once you're done - the structure will be stronger than ever. It's my preferred approach.Hey all,

I am working on flushing out a beam. this beam extends from the exterior wall of the house to a post in the middle. The post in the middle supports another drop beam that extends to the other exterior wall of the home. I am flushing out only one of the beams and leaving the other as a drop beam.

It is best to wait for engineer as you haven't provided any specs of of the project.Hi everyone,
I'm getting into complete remodels and finishing jobs, moving past the usual trim and cabinetry work that I usually do. I'm starting with GC'ing my first complete basement finish job in a few weeks. I've had some experience with concrete fastening but I would still consider myself a novice compared to most. I've searched and read a bunch of threads and articles and I'm finding a few themes:

1. "It depends" is always the answer when comparing Tapcon vs PAF in general. People have their preferences, but they seem to be based on specific applications. Block vs poured, old vs new work, etc, etc. So I'm describing my next specific application below. 
2. Reviews are mixed with Tapcon. Including my own reviews. I'd say I've had "okay" luck with them, but I've had my share of snapped heads and replaced enough worn drill bits to be wary of them. They also seem very time consuming. 
3. Reviews seem good with Ramset and great with Hilti, but it sounds like there are dangers of splitting the concrete and not sinking all the way, especially in hardened concrete. I have very limited experience with powder actuated. All the experiences were good, but it's not enough to draw a conclusion yet. 

I have about 100' of 2x4 framing to do with treated bottom plates, mostly around the perimeter of a basement slab that's about 20 yrs old. I was thinking about investing in the ramset .27 semi-auto unit, but there are places where I'll be nailing within 3" from the edge (though, I suppose the slab is resting against the footing so it's not that bad.). And the concrete has had plenty of time to cure, so I'm sure it's plenty hard. I would think this helps with edge cracking danger but makes it harder to drive all the way. 

Anyway, what would you guys do? Anyone that does this regularly and has any tips? has anyone actually had a cracked/broken edge?

Thanks in advance.I would not by a new expensive tool for only 100 LF of wall. Lot's of different ways to anchor plates to a floor. 
If you already have a hammer drill, it makes no sense to get away from Tapcons for such a small job.I would always figure out some way to justify buying a new tool.

Andy.https://andytardif.wixsite.com/websiteI always start with a ramset, if it doesn't work I go to tapcons or wedge anchors. If it's structural I use whatever the engineer speced on the plans.i have seen thousands of Tapcons installed with very little problems.

usually a wrong diameter hole or not deep enough.

or a guy leaning WAY too hard on a impact driver...

there was a brief period of time where i think Tapcon had some bad steel as we were breaking way more than we should have. not the current case

look at the simpson Titen if you dont like Tapcon.

edge breaking can be problematic no matter what fastener method you choose.

like fishindude said i sure as hell wouldn't buy a new ramset for such little bit of plate.

but then tools are tools.....i have seen thousands of Tapcons installed with very little problems.

He's going to end up owning a ramset sooner or later, why not get it today?Thanks for the replies so far. Sounds like Tapcon opinions have improved. Either way, I’m investing in a tool as I plan to do more of this in the future. 

If I go Tapcon’s, I’m gonna buy a rotary hammer to make drilling easier. Rotary hammers start at about $200 for basic. Upside to that is the rotary hammer can do more than just this work.

If I go powder, I figure I ought to get the .27 for extra power when needed and a muffler. Ramset starts at $200.

Either way, it’s a small investment compared to the long term expected revenue. 

By my rough calculations, I think I’m looking at about 50 fasteners for this job. Seems like the speed of powder would save me at least an hour on this job? ...Assuming it doesn’t give me any other headache...which is kinda what I’m curious about.You can get away with a hammer drill for most tapcons. If you needed more anchoring then youd need to step up to an sds. You can't use the included drill bit with an sds.
Just depends on how much your doing. I have two ramsets but use them very sparingly. Just more versatility without more weight. 
You could also do the pnumatic one, should you have that many to doThis is my favorite product for a 2x flat onto concrete. 
Average cordless drill with hammer function will work fine. 
We used to call them rawl spikes, but that may be a regional thing. 
Once its in, there is no removing it. 

If you're getting into gc work, you should have ramser and hammer drill anyway. So go ahead and buy those too. We will understand.









Sent from my SM-N960U using TapatalkYou can very easily drive the ramset nails by hand, I do it all the time. I have the 27 cal gun, haven't taken out of the box in years. 

I also just used 3" tapcons to set forms on a concrete footing. I used a cordless Milwaukee SDS Plus it worked great.Tom

www.gebcon.comDo you all glue your plates as well?do those hammer in nails -they look cool . i got rid of my powder actuated gun .thought it was so cool when i was young .just never really need it .You have to have a hammer drill /rotary hammer -just a basic tool . I for one think the blue tapcons or look alike ones are a pain .Grex makes a concrete screw that is much better .But you gotta love those titans . 
if the concrete screw fails sometimes i pound plastic anchors in the hole and then run a good construction screw in .or if you can get them old lead inserts . but they do spin out at times .
I have used hammer in fastners but yet to find one for 2x lumber . Oh and theres the double up sinker method I learned framing .shove to sinkers at the same time into a 3/16" hole .
you'll be fine no matter what you try . kinda have to find what works for you and every job is different .i recall one job where concrete was extra hard ,used up a bunch of 3/16 bits . cooked them .I have a Ramset I haven't used in at least 10 years. Varying amounts of concrete cure and density practically guarantee inconsistency in how they set--though they're usually "good enough" despite that. Tapcons are indeed a bit slower, but much more consistent once you learn how to use them properly.

Keep in mind too, that for something like basement framing, you generally don't need a boatload of fasteners in that bottom plate. Just enough to keep it from shifting sideways.Letusbee ... i have used a very similar bent nail fastener, difference being it had a single flat head, not a double. Not sure why you would want a DH ... it’s dang near impossible to pull back out.Every time I use my ramset I just make a lot of noise and blow big chunks out of whatever I'm nailing too.

SDS and a tapcons are my favorite way to fasten, either that or lead sets. They are a little pricey, but more low profile if you need that. Last time I used them was for fastening track for an ICF wall, worked great for that.Doing something constructive at once is better than figuring out the best thing to do hours later. -Heinleinhoye0017 said:

thats the one id most often carry. I think its under 50 bucks for the .22.. you set it off with a hammer. 
I had a guy so upset because it worked better than his hilti... his hilti kept jamming.. lolLike NYCB I use the lead sets. they work great I used to tap con but the lead sets are quick and really hold great. I don't have to drill then pull the driver bit apart and then drive a tap con. I also bought a ramset once for a big basement job but same as NYCB it made a lot of noise and blew big chunks of the concrete off the surface.

I installed a lot of those ceilings in the 1970's & 80's. There are 3 different systems for radiant heat ceilings.

system #1. Hangers go in & hang ceiling board. Sparky comes in & installs cable. Hangers come back in & roll a heavy coat of mud over the cables, then hangs a 2nd layer of board over that & walls out. 

system#2. Hangers hang ceilings. Sparky runs cable. Hangers come back & hang walls only. Tapers come in & finish walls only. Then taper applies a plaster like product called Radex over the cables, then textures ceiling.

system#3. Hanger hangs a drywall called Pan-Electric on the ceilings. It's a 5/8s" drywall with the cables sandwiched in the center of the board. Tapers finish like reg. board.

Hot air rises, not heat. Those radiant heated ceilings I believe originally were used in Europe as back up heat when the temperatures got really cold and primary heat source couldn't keep up. Not worth it in this day and age with a properly built house.Heat doesn't rise

That sounds like a tricky job. In reference to whether it is a good idea to have a heated ceiling. The sun is a good example of a radiant heat source. Radiant heat flows in the direction of least resistance. So if the insulation above the ceiling is greater than the r-value of the plaster it will warm the room beneath it. Similar to a big low temperature radiator.I did a kitchen reno a couple years ago. They ended up putting in a forced gas furnace to avoid all the icicles.
Work there was tough for a bald guy like me, I litterally got a burn on the top of my head.

Thanks!Turned on "holmes inspections" and watched some "pro" install an exhaust fan...all wrong!! Used insulated corrugated hose which reduces the fans performance by at least 25%, then has a 90 degree bend, right off the fan, further reducing the performance by another 25-50%.

It's not "wrong" per se, but yes, there will be less air flow than with a perfectly straight run of smooth hard pipe. The loss generally only becomes meaningful when you have a long run and/or a bunch of bends.While I agree that Holmes is no genius, running rigid duct for a bath exhaust fan isn't the only way to do it correctly. 

In 10 years of remodel, I haven't come across one bath vent fan that didn't use flex (if they vented it outside at all), and most of the 'vented' ones are just laid down at the nearest soffit vent. Now can that cause mold in an attic? Possibly, but not likely if the attic is properly ventilated. Now, can an improperly vented bathroom promote mildew / mold growth? Sure. Will using flex over rigid be that difference? Probably not.

While I hate Holmes' arrogant demeanor, I can't really call him a hack based off of that one example.Remodelor said:

No argument with that Tin. Mike has done well to bring to light the dangers to the HO of hiring hacks. On one interview he tells the HO to always ask to see the tradesmans' licence. 

But he doesn't have one.

Like I said he can oversee or whatever, just don't pass yourself off as a carpenter. It offends me. Lots of guys have spent four years apprenticing and then another six years or so getting good at their trade, and Mike just walks in and pretends to be a carpenter.

I take offense to anything that demeans my trade. I think the other tradesmen here feel the same way. Mike promotes always using licenced trades. But he doesn't give the same respect to carpentry.

Sorry, no slack for him. Now he's doing the same thing in home inspections. Wonder how the guys who went to school and have 10 years building experience (as Mike himself says) feel about him faking that too.katoman said:

DavidI think I saw this on some home remodeling show years ago.

Pretty cool...and inexpensive."We'll be fine"My concern would really be the existing block wall. You can drystack and stucco up to 8' IIRC. The existing may not be up to adding more height. 

Filled cells, rebar, bonding, a good mason should figure out what can be done with the existing walls.I can't see how blowing off the roof, adding a course of block, then reframing the roof is going to net any sort of return on a flip.In a flipper's mind.....beat down the unlicensed subs, paint over everything and find a sucker to offload it to when done. Very little pride in making something correct or built to last.....only looking for that max dollar not matter who suffers.Live NOW…….in the NOWI looked at a property with plaster and lath, 1 1/2 stories.

I've actually seen a couple good flips, and a fair bit of trash. 
I once helped a fellow who was doing his first flip, subbing everything and getting really bad advice from his subs. After I framed it for him, I gave him a list of subs, and few ideas. A few months later I got a check in the mail from him for 10% of the money I saved him, the check was for three thousand bucks.Plumbers and other hillbilly engineers: Had a customer ask me to diagnose a faucet that had very low flow. Matching faucet was running perfectly, and the aerator was not clogged up. So I start tracing back the plumbing and I find this under the sink.

I've never seen anything quite like it, in 18 years of replacing faucets and whatnot for people. Is this some kind of crazy homeowner ******* engineering? Incidentally, I re-did the plumbing so the faucet was plumbed straight to the valves like normal, and still had the same result. So I'll be replacing the faucets next week, which is no big deal, but I just thought I'd see if you all had ever seen anything like this before.www.alchemyconstruction.coAre the hot and cold both run into that piece?

Very interesting, thank you. Wouldn't that affect all the faucets though? This is a two sink vanity and the matching faucet runs perfectly, and was also plumbed correctly. 

Sent from my SM-G981V using Tapatalkwww.alchemyconstruction.coWhen you say plumbed correctly you mean no "tee"? 

My guess is the "other" sink is up stream of the sink with the issue. The recirculation should be at the farthest fixture from the water heater.

The "tee" is more than a tee, the system needs to be properly "setup" by bleeding the sensor. The sensor regulates how much water hot can enter the cold when the pump comes on. On these systems I’d set the pump to come on about 30 minutes before the homes demand time.

Setup properly, the system works well.

TomGot called in to look at tiling tub walls,I don't know if anything that can go over 2x4s on the flat, do any of you? 

2 short walls are framed regular, the 5' wall was done on the flat for who knows why (bigger tub maybe?)

Thought I had a pic, but I can't find it

-Rich-RichIMO, those walls move too easily. When I frame on the flat, I go 12" OC and they still move too easily.I've been using the laminated studs for shower walls. I think they would work ok on the flat, they're definitely stiffer than a 2x3.Yeah, there was a lot of flex in the wall and I told them there was no way I could tile it as is.

Pretty sure they just had a fiberglass surround before, they were looking to do something nicer

The fun of it is, the homeowner started this months ago. Tub is already in place, so I've got to work around that

I've got a couple ideas to maybe test out and see how it'll go. The cs14 made me think of angle iron. I usually use kerdi board, but maybe 5/8 xp in that wall with kerdi over it would be the better bet.

Has to be stiff AF. I don't need to explain why to you. Try running 8-10" on center.

Unless those trusses were manufactured requiring center support, you don't need anything. That's why you contact the truss company, or an engineer if you can't find the truss company.This site is for professional contractors and tradesmen.

Thread closed.I need to reframe a window, but my house is old and uses odd size studs. Most of them are actually 2"x4" not regular 2x4s. How do I replace these? Do I have to get like 2x6s and cut them down, or can I use 2x4sand make up the gap with some strips?Both ways work. Buying 2x6 and ripping down is a little more expensive, but you end up with plenty of tomato stakes.I'd shim out 2X4s because cutting that much off of one side of a 2X6 can cause the board to bow.1/2” ply glued & screwed

Click to expand...

Man, yes. So I have a CMU block wall as the girder and I assume it's on top of a concrete footer (I haven't seen the footer). If I understand you correctly, it's possible that I would need a solid pier down to the footing cut through my block girder? And only then could I set the post for the beam?

FYI, I know there is fungus on the floor joists. I am getting them treated and a vapor barrier put in place. Luckily no rot or termite damage.The beam carry load is the with of the house perpendicular to the girder (the joist span on each side of the girder)

That said I'm not giving you structural advice here I'm just curious to know what size that beam would need to be.

As the foundation and the footing goes that is a different story and the integrity of it and if it can support the additional load, i.e that would depend on the footing width, depth, and the soil.

So as an example with basic calculation...If you plan on doing a habitable attic space to meet L/360 floor load criteria @30LB PFT design load...and if your building width is 24' you need a beam to support a total of 13,320LB load that 370LB per foot... so every bearing point on each side has to support an additional 6,660LB. 

That said a 5 1/4" x 18" beam can support 391LB PFT which is only good for a 26' span and the weight of that beam is 578.8 LB so I don't know how you plan on getting that beam inside, because the beam to span 36' will be even more and a much larger beam.

You should consult with an engineer and see what would be a steel I-Beam option.

Good luckI never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​Keep in mind, for replacing a ridge board with a structural ridge on a hopped roof, you'll most likely have columns coming down through living space, not the exterior walls.

We are adding a shower to a basement half bath on concrete, no big deal we will cut to the toilet, find the 3” and our plumber will tie in etc and ensure the proper fall etc before inspection. Ok fast forward and they’ve installed the shower and we have an 8x8” area around the plumbing that is exposed underslab grade/gravel. Plumber says it will be good, close the walls up, inspector comes in and says...”you know you can fill the area with sand and pour a thin layer of topping mix concrete over the top” this will keep bugs etc from traveling up through it.

Sounds like a good plan to me and we’ve been doing it for years, and then today. A radon mitigation company comes in and says, “you really should fill that area with great stuff foam to get a good airseal and later on if there is an issue the plumber can cut it away”.

ok if you’ve ever messed with the aftermath of foam that needs to be removed...well you know what I’m talking about. Not that I have had callbacks but ugh the thought of foam around the drain...yeah no.

So what are you guys doing?Oh what the years have taught me in the industry...

I thought you meant a stand alone shower, didn't realize it was a tub, makes sense as I reread it. I can't remember the last time I dealt with a tub on a slab, loose filling the hole makes sense. Foam board could be used with some expandable foam at the edges if bugs were a concern

- Rich-RichAnother fine idea from somebody that has never had a hammer in their hand. Put some sand around the drain & pour

MikeI would have no problem at all putting concrete back in the hole. Just wrap the pipe with sill seal like any other through the slab penetration.

If you need to perform some kind of maintenance on the p trap, you’re going to have to remove the tub, and the tile surround, anyway. Chipping out a fistful of concrete is not going to make or break the job.

I was just throwing out alternatives I've done in the past in case you couldn't find itwww.alchemyconstruction.coIf you can get near the same locking profile, replace with any color. Go to Sherwin Williams get a paint match. Can't tell the difference most times. Also a paint match will look better than the new pc. New siding of the same will stand out as it's not faded.

If you don't have a good fit / locking profile take any D5 that fits. Cut the top nail bead off. Overlay right on to the old siding. Then do the paint match.Steve
Greensboro, NCThanks Onmyway, I think we're going to go with vinyl shake at the entrance. This way we should have some extra for any future damage. Plus fade won't be an issue thanks Wefix.Anyone ever use this siding product? Any reviews or thoughts?

Da Vinci on the web or Da Vinci On FacebookI ordered some samples of it. Looks to be some ok stuff. Bad thing is for us out west here no suppliers that I saw. Nice locking system with it.Thanks Randy! I have a long-time customer that is considering this siding. Since we don’t do exteriors, he’s just asking for my opinion… what I know about the product.

How would you rate it compared to Hardie or SmartSide?I love what I do and I'm very good at it!

Da Vinci on the web or Da Vinci On FacebookI really like the concept of it sand thought I had a customer sold on it a year back but the wanted a colour not available in Celect. 

Hopefully some one on here has some experience with it as I was thinking of using it on my house next year.https://builddaley.com/Couple pictures of it. It would be interesting to know what the pricing is on the stuff. Being no suppliers close I did not look into to it any father.

New here. I'm Australian based. And complete mostly Renovations.

Anyway this is the situation and I really need some help.

I've included the interior designer cost in my contract price (quote) and notified the home owner that the interior designer is in the cost - but they've come back and said they want to finalise designs before putting down a deposit - which i was going to use to pay the designers deposit with prior to anything commencing? 

Whats happening? Will they take the designs and run leaving me to pay the cost or will they finalise designs and go ahead with a deposit? Why not pay prior to an interior design consult - they're reason was 'to get everything right prior to placing a deposit'.

Whats going on here? :jester: don't want to get screwed $$.. any advice is much appreciated.

thank you.you are robbing peter to pay paul...

fast way to end up in the sewer...

get the designer fee upfront or have the HO hire & PAY the designer...

that way you are not involved in what the HO's don't like...'No tickee, no washee'They're leveraging you. No freebees.So how long have you been in business? You should of had that figured out before consultation. Or collect the fee plus your % then proceedHow do I charge customer for contracted interior designer?

Hi,

I'm a builder in home renovations and don't have a designer on hand full time/on wages to use to create 'free' designs for my customers.

Thanksyou shouldn't post something referring to pictures you will post later when you're asking or recommendations. 

all the storefront frames I've worked with have used used exposed screws with backer plates. the plates they screw into have a little 'wiggle' room, think it was a thicker metal plate that was tapped for the screw size. 

do yourself a favor and buy a cheap knockdown door frame and install it vs trying to rig something together if you don't have the skillset to figure it out. it's not rocket science, but if you're not good at figuring out a solid install, the frame might start moving in 3 months after it get's stressed from constant use.Here is the pic sorry for not posting originally.You will want a compatible metal frame. Anything you try and kludge together will move. That door will have a lot of leverage on those small pins.

Sent from my SM-N975U using TapatalkMy local area is starting to require basement ceilings and stairwells be dry walled in new construction- even when the basement is unfinished. This makes finishing an unfinished basement more of a hassle. 

In these cases I can’t decide what is best to frame in the walls that run parallel to joists. Do I tear out all the drywall in the basement? Do I use a rotozip or something similar to cut drywall back to the next joist to get blocking in place? Is there a better option? 

Thanksadd blocking, double joists, etc prior to drywall.

some well placed conduit, may not be code required, can make running electrical easier.

i have seen fire rated assemblies that required drywall against framing then other framing was just set on top of the drywall and anchored to blocking, doublers etc...The drywall is in place already- no blocking. Yes I wish home builders would do this but they don’t.then start your selective demo to get blocking etc in place.

one thing to keep an eye on, an consider, is to re-rock the ceiling rathet than a bunch of patches.

talk it over with your drywall guy & see how it works out.Basementguy1 said:

Where are you that they require that. Sounds like a dumb practice. “Welcome to your new home, this is your unfinished basement that you can’t access any of the plumbing/ electrical to make any changes”

Probably cheaper to rip it all down and replace than have everyone try and work with it and then patch the crap out of it.https://builddaley.com/Really don't need a ton of blocking there. With a doubled top plate, you can easily go every 8' with the blocking. Tie shorter walls to adjacent walls and your good to go.I just designed a few basement layouts for a few homeowners, and I met with their contractor who will be doing the work, it was the same situation, the entire development had their basement ceilings drywalled.
We will be doing the same thing as Griz suggested cut the drywall and put in blocking... he was also considering applying glue to the top plate and using Hilti 1/4" Snaptoggle anchors.I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​Expect to see this more. IMO, the driver is protection of firefighters with engineered floor systems, which tend to fail earlier and unpredictably in a fire.The situation has come up for me before and I have used toggle bolts and glue like Greg mentioned. Haven't heard back that there were any issues. That being said these were cheap jobs where it didn't make sense to do it properly...Begrudgingly, I think I would mark it, cut the minimum amount of necessary openings (beyond joist to joist), add the blocking, knife the crap off the patch edges (for the finisher, esp. if it's you) put the rock back, and just keep moving.

Or how about cutting a 3.5 x 3.5 opening on the line of the wall, slathering some liquid nail on a patch plywood block, and tucking it up there to glue to the back of the rock?TheConstruct said:

Click to expand...

Cheap or not...It's not a load-bearing wall so it's not going anywhere even if someone slams into it. 
Did a view jobs turning a loft into an office and most of them had a partition running parallel to the ceiling joists, architects specs and detail was glue and cross nailing 16"OC as an alternative if there is no solid blocking on top. After sheetrock, you will never tell that it's not nailed to blocking.I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​This is a requirement of the 2015 IRC. So depends if your jurisdiction has adopted this section or not and subsequently how they enforce it. For instance, a county gov around here adopted the code in full and started enforcing the lid with fire tape and foam for draftstopping. After enough complaining by homeowners and contractors they changed the rules to screwed off but not taped or sealed... smarter folks than me...It’s all fire related. Take down block rerockWhy would you tear out all the drywall to add blocking to a 14” strip? I’d move the wall out to just below that first or last floor joist and sell it to the customer as a highly insulated wall long before I’d touch the drywall. 

If the first and last 2.5” wide I joists are 16” oc and you have an 8” concrete wall, you need to move your 2x4 non load bearing end walls in by about 5” extra. One side could be less depending on the floor framing layout.


But I’d glue and Ramset or tapcon blocks to the concrete before I’d even do all that.Kingcarpenter1 said:

Now you made the job much more difficult, now you need to fireblock the joist bays

Leave the drywall up and cut holes or do like Greg suggestedMy s/r sub would have it down blocked & back up cleaned up half day tops. If any mechanicals need addressed call him back when ready. Hell w/all the patches.

I use a really small nailset and tap the edges of the broken bit , it usually loosens up and falls outPhillips bit metal is probably harder than the screw metal, so drilling would be a no go.

If all else fails, MIG a nut onto it.I’ve tapped at them more than once with a concrete nail until it falls out.Last resort gently get behind it with sawzall & metal blade with spakyl & t/u paint handyDrilling it will eventually work.tjbnwi said:

Why can't you use 5/16" lags with lead shields and fender washers?? 

If the brick isn't stable then maybe you need to have a meeting...I prefer caulk-ins over lead expansion anchors. Just a personal preference.

TomNever heard those referred to as caulk ins? We call them machine screw anchors.It al depends on the brick some are just terrible and some in great condition.

I've gotten products from each of them.I am planning my kitchen renovation and wanted to get some input from guys who’ve done it.

The kitchen sits in an open room along with a living room and dining room. I’d like to change the layout to create more usable space outside the kitchen. (Below see existing layout and new layout). The new layout I came up with makes more use of the wall opposite the windows (lots of dead space there now). It also gives me 3 feet more for a dining table.

I am going to replace the tiled kitchen with the same wood that’s in the rest of the living space. 4” red oak (I think) stained Jacobean brown. I think a continuous floor medium gives the room a larger look.

I am still playing with the idea of swapping the cooktop location (currently drawn on the island in both the existing and new layouts) with the kitchen sink. I know this will involve some tricky kitchen island plumbing and rerouting of the gas and copper lines.

What are the pros & cons of having the cooktop on the island vs. on the wall?

Some I can think of:
* No drop down recirculating exhaust hood. The exhaust hood would be under a cabinet. Unfortunately I am forced to use a ductless recirculating exhaust in either scenario - there is no flume system that can carry cooking exhaust in my building.
* People don’t see your dirty cooktop. They see my dirty dishes.

Any thoughts or input would be appreciated!!!

Thanks

























Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkWhat is more important to you... More Kitchen/storage or more space? The answer to that will define design going forward...Move the island towards the 9' number in the second drawing, align it with the end cabinet, create an L of cabinets on the wall to the left of the island, end them with the dining room side of the island. 

TomKAP, yeah I didn’t really think about the storage. Duh.

Tom, you’re suggesting a U-shaped kitchen? I liked the idea of being able to enter on both sides. I agree I should extend the island to the 9’. I might even make that whole back wall longer. Its really dead space.

I’ll play around with some new layouts.

KAP, yeah I didn’t really think about the storage. Duh.

Tom, you’re suggesting a U-shaped kitchen? I liked the idea of being able to enter on both sides. I agree I should extend the island to the 9’. I might even make that whole back wall longer. Its really dead space.

I’ll play around with some new layouts.

Thanks for the input.

I'd reverse the island seating so you can view the living/dining room.

I wouldn't; that would encroach heavily on the work triangle. And unless you're in the habit of hosting large gatherings, you'd seldom have both areas occupied at the same time.for me, too often designs look great on paper..then ya go at it and it looks like chit.

I like to mock things up, either by taping off the floors as to where things will be... and most often I go even futher and build mock up cabinets, etc out of scrap wood and position them into place, or move them around as need be. It gives me and the HO a much clearer picture of what it's going to feel like.... and look like.greg24k said:

Exactly what I was thinking. The only thing I'd play around with is rotating the island 90 to parallel the sink wall, then you could overhang the top for an additional seat at the end. Maybe even sneak a bookcase on the end by the oven for cookbook storage

Most people watch TV now while eating, reversing the island allows line of sight to the living/family room. 

Never got the concept of the work triangle. When I cook or bake all of the ingredients are laid out and pre measured prior. No need to walk from spot to spot when prepping a meal.

You may have a point about TV. In our house and our kids' houses, it's off during dinner.

My wife gets everything out, does her creative explosion, and collapses in exhaustion while the cooking takes place--with stuff sitting all over the counters and sink.

I clean as I prep, so when the cooking starts there's practically nothing left to clean or put away. Different strokes.If you want to turn the island around and face the kitchen window, you can do that also.I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​Tinstaafl said:

We don't do the TV thing, I know most people do including our adult children. Sign of the times.

I do not allow my wife in the kitchen when any serious prep and cooking is happening, a skill she never acquired is food prep.

A little background on myself, I am in my early 20s living in Ontario Canada. 

I purchased my first house at the end of 2017. The house is a semi, it came with an unfinished basement and a somewhat nice upstairs. I painted, blocked off the stairs for a stackable washer, cleaned up the kitchen and put a nice new fridge in – very minimal. 3 bed, 1 bath, kitchen, laundry and living room. 

In the basement with a separate entrance I built a 2 bed, 1 bath, kitchen, laundry and living space. All the work was done by myself except for a small amount of carpet and doors. 

Yesterday I purchased a similar house and it closes at the end of April. This one is pretty gross though, infested with roaches, but I bought it about $150k lower than market value. I plan on doing this one as a flip as I don’t want to deal with tenants. This is a 4 bed, 2 bath, 4 level house including basement. (one bath is only a two piece but backs on to a large closet)

Anyways, I’m looking for advise on what you all would put into it, minimal but effective. My thoughts are below: 

-All new plumbing fixtures & turn 2 piece bath into 3. All plumbing costs I can get covered, so this is a give.
-New flooring, most likely a mix of vinyl plank and laminate in dry areas (all flooring in the place is shot, and basement flooring was wrecked by a leaky washing machine)
-LED pots in all rooms except beds.
-New baseboard, doors, casings & trim. 
-New kitchen upstairs & install a kitchen downstairs to make a second apartment (house has separate entrance).
-Stainless appliances upstairs, basic appliances downstairs.

All work is done by myself. 

NEXT POST WILL HAVE SOME PICTURES – THEY ARE GRAPHIC!So here are some pictures, all the junk has to be cleared out on closings along with appliances. I would love to get peoples advise and post pictures and updates as construction goes!More pics.Also, if anyone would like to see some of my works in my other house please feel free to ask and I can put some pics up.Is your new house a semi like the previous one? If it's in Toronto it's probably pretty narrow and has no internal load-bearing walls (thus easy to take out). If it was my house I'd go open concept on the ground floor. But for the sake of all that is holy do NOT used vinyl or laminate flooring anywhere but in the basement. The market wants hardwood throughout and that is what you must install.

That is not bad. About 3 dumpsters, a couple long days and that house will look completely different.

Advice on what I would put into it? An exterminator.

Throw everything in the house away. If you have roaches, they will be in everything.JBH said:

This is a house on the same street with the same floor plan that just sold.I always price this stuff as if subs are doing it all. $15k per kitchen, $5k per bath for mid market.

Again, not enough info, but $10k would be a placeholder.hdavis said:

Flooring is what is scaring me. I definitely at least need hardwood in the main floor and that tripled my flooring budget.

I was thinking it may be acceptable if you can almost match it with an oak looking flooring? Id have to add appliances on top of this of course.

Not at all, they're in addition to... the list I gave you are the things that excite buyers, which is what you're after this time in doing a flip... they are in addition to your list... IMHO, a stackable is a turn-off to a buyer (especially with kids) and locating it in the kitchen, think about the logistics of that... while you found a "place" it's not an attractive one and diminishes the value of the new kitchen, as now it's a kitchen/laundry area... who wants dirty clothes in the same area they eat/prepare food, dryer lint venting (and it does even with the best unit) into the kitchen area?

Again, check with your realtor on market conditions, but based on what you posted, you'd probably be better off considering maximizing the value of the home by converting the downstairs into a combination of an office/man cave/she-room, great/entertainment room and a laundry room with room to work (i.e. - storage cabs above regular washer/dryer and folding area)... they can do laundry and cook simultaneously without concern... this will expand your buying audience as opposed to narrowing it...

Most people who are buying a 4 bedroom aren't necessarily interested in being roomies with a tenant, especially if they have kids... 

When it's done, in a sellers market, talk to your realtor about the strategy of pricing it 5% below the market for the Open House to get a bidding war going,..sunkist said:

Just my.02¢Adapt, Improvise, Overcome.Hey all,

I'm talking on a house repainting job. The house is 100+ years old with cedar siding; there's 3 old layers / colors of paint. It's peeling everywhere. After attempting to sand and scrap by hand it's clear that this will be far to time consuming and won't look good. 

All the paint needs to be stripped off. My question is what would you recommend as the quickest / most effective way to get the paint off? I've read options like Infrared (Eco-Strip / Speedheater), Chemicals, or even something like the the Paint Shaver Pro.

What have folks found as the most effective method? Attached is a simple picture of the house for reference.

Thanks!

I know a lot don't care, but as a contractor and not certified one is not really suppose to work on them. 

Thing is some of that old wood will not take paint like it should and last, endless job of painting. It does not take many repainting to pay for new siding.If you get caught on the job, there could be trouble.

Even if you’re just “helping out” a friend.

Contractors are the ones that are supposed to know better. The state doesn’t have a whole lot of power over HomeOwner, but they do over your licensure.

That said, maybe a heat gun?

You can heat it and Scrape it off when it bubbles. Consequently, if you accidentally catch the house on fire, it’s not so big that it would take a long time to rebuild.

x 2Adapt, Improvise, Overcome.Looks like the siding has been replaced before.

There is no easy way to get all the paint off. Something that size, you may be better off removing all the siding and stripping off site, then reinstalling. Lye stripping will remove any damaged wood fibers so it's like having new wood to paint. You can also flip the biards when you reinstall.

There are a lot of prohibited practices that could be useful, but are banned. I believe I could do that whole house without triggering RRP compliance simply by making a coring drill bit out of thin wall tubing just big enough to core around each nail. The effected area is the area of the holes. You have 20sqft of area before compliance kicks in.

Strip, do any hole filling and repairs and reinstall.Are you sure there is lead. Have you swabbed it.

I've had older houses where only the trim is lead and the siding is not.

I've always had newer houses where it all is.

Swab, then come up with a plan.

If it is lead, then I would just knock the loose stuff of, prime and paint.

Most guys I know aren't doing total stripping any more.

Too much liability.

I hope your "friend" is paying you a crap ton of money, because any way you strip that is going to take a long time.

Heat is the most effective and cleanest, but slow. Just don't use a gun over 1100 watts and I think it is still allowed with RRP.

However, test it first.

Sent from my SM-N975U using TapatalkPhuck that replace it.Thank you all for jumping in with input :thumbup: I can check for lead...

Ultimately...it sounds like there's no simple solution; (A) a sh*t ton of time to strip the paint with heat, take it offsite, flip the boards, etc or (B) spend more and just straight up replace the siding.

While this may not be the case 100% of the time, depends on how bad it is now, trim boards are the worst. And with a lot of the paint today , they will be redoing it in a few years again.VinylHanger said:

If you test it and it comes up negative, so you do all your prep and paint

You are still in violation of RRP if you aren't RRP certifiedWeathered fibers which cause adhesion problems come off in a lye strip. I've used lye based deck stripper with siding installed on a l8mited area before. The stuff will attack all kinds of things and kill plants. Painting after neutralization is great and you get long coating life.

Sent from my SM-N975U using TapatalkI used the paint shaver pro on my house about 10 years ago. The house had 2.5 in lap siding, was a two story house. roughly 34 ft square. It did a fantastic job, had it hooked up to a vac to help keep the dust down. I think I still have it, if you want it, I am willing to sellOn a house that size I would use an infra red heater. It would take a while yes, but what a nice job it does overall. Takes off all the layers of paint at one time. It doesn't release lead into the air and is much less likely to cause a fire than some electric heaters will.

couldn`t you sand-blast that sucker?
you`d have a lot of sand left over , and the wood would have that orange-peel finish , but it could strip it off pretty decent , no?

or even just pressure wash it down with a lot of pressure , 
then ,whats left is definitely on there pretty good , meaning you could 
sand , and prime over it and paint 

i guess it matters if the client /friend/ relative expect it to look like new wood , or doesn't mind if it isn't perfect.
if their ecpecting it to look perfect , then thats your answer , demo all the existing wood ,and start will all new wood .woodspike said:

Once again no RRP should not be doing period. Responses like yours is why we have ended up with the RRP rules in the first place. Sand blasting or pressure washing , how are you going to contain it and not get the lead paint all over everything.Sand blasting and pressure washing just remove the loose stuff. Also neither is allowed generally under RRP rules.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.There is only one way I know of to not trigger RRP compliance doing this.I'm going to be remodeling this rotten unabomber shack if I get some free time this Spring. It's in a historic district and they're really pushing me to salvage as much of the original structure. I'm essentially rebuilding it but I agreed to retain the same roof shape/pitch and reuse as much of the old car siding as I can. 

Would it be wise to fur the siding out and create a rainscreen or would you just nail it over WRB/tyvec/felt and sheathing? The place has been ravaged by termites and rot but somehow this car siding, probably 100 years old, is solid and intact.

If I use a rain screen, what is the best way to create strapping while still allowing vertical ventilation/watershed path? Does this even matter? I've read both arguments... some say horizontally run nailers will still keep the siding off and allow enough drying for the small bulk water leaks that may occur...

Take a look at this beauty:Proposed plans:Need a can of gas?:whistling Just wondering what makes it so historical?Looks like it used to be a carriage house or something.

If you're using OSB sheathing, you better make it sunscreen. That close to the ground, termites are going to love it.Carsiding = TEMPORARY siding IMHO, never will be a fair rainscreen.

Maybe with massive 32" + overhanging eves on ALL wall, stopping ABOVE the splash line from heavy rain fall.....

Never air tight....originally scraps stolen for wainscoting, from repair yards and RR Car makers...

Maybe with some sort of open air cavity furring to allow continuous air flow to eve vent from foundation air intake venting....

Gutters with long turn outs

If you do use 'Rail'- CS, back prime and seal treat all ends, you don't want the t & g "glued" by over painting?:whistling = cracked similar to paneled wood doors.

drip edges on openings? plastic base? Faux thin brick.

dig out immediate surroundings to 10-12 feet away fo r 2-3% minimum grade or raise up entire BLD, 10-12", install Vapour barrier under sructure....Damproofing material between all foundation to wood transitions, to stop structural rotting.I might be an Idiot, but I know things that You don't: Please wait till after you get my know-how to insult me....hdavis said:

I'm planning to raise it up, add a perimeter drain and regrade the surrounding area. Somehow, neglected for close to 100 years, in the dirt and full of termites, this carsiding is still mostly solid. The termites ate up this brown composite pressboard T111 looking paneling that had been install over top of it.

I have to save the carsiding or replace with a comparable vertical carsiding because it's in a historic zoning....I'd probably accidentally back my dump truck through it 

Then start over :thumbsup:Use 6mm coroplast. Rip it so the venting is vertical. Install it horizontally. You could also just use 4mm which is much more common, but I like 1/4” space minimal. You could just use 1x nailers horizontally. If it isn’t going to be a conditioned building then you probably don’t need active venting, but I always like to actively vent it when possible.

You'll need to verify the footing size the existing block sits on. Each size of block requires different size footing. Dig out a corner to try to evaluate. You can drill through the top of the footing with a hammer drill to determine its thickness.

What size building is this ? An excavator / backhoe can tear out all in a day, leave you with a clean trench. Something to think about.Steve

How high are your walls and how much unbalanced backfill. You can gout the block with concrete and rebar and add a lot of strength.

What size building is this ? An excavator / backhoe can tear out all in a day, leave you with a clean trench. Something to think about.

I believe the frost line here is 30". I'm not even sure there is a footing under this mess. I expect to be laying up maybe 7 courses so I might have 40" of unbalanced fill. I'll probably have to pour a new footing. On this soil I'll probably need a 13x6" footing (based on IRC code tables). The building is only 18'x16' so it's basically a tiny efficiency studio apartment.


Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalkso i just found out from my fabricator,that i don't own the whole slab? is this common , industry standard?Yeahyes, you only pay for what the top size is. You can buy the whole slab if you want, but you would have to move it and store itJust had a customer find that out.

$1100 for a piece of quartz...22" x 42""We'll be fine"You can probably buy the remnants for $10-$20 square foot if you really want it.Remnants work well for vanities.

really you could throw square foot prices in the garbage they don't work for anything I ever do. you have to understand most places will charge you for a template which is a trip out to the site in advance. Charge you for cutouts and the return trip to install it plus tax.They didn't have any remnants they liked."We'll be fine"I just happen to know where you could pick up some Reminence cheap!The Following User Says Thank You to Snobnd For This Useful Post: Leonot my experience. I have two remnants sitting at the yard. I can use them and pay the SF price for prep/install, which is $30/sf (I think). The last slab was a L3, ran about $1200/slab.For specially chosen stone, I learned that I had to pay for the entire slab, but the fabricator also assumed they get to keep the extra as a remnant. You would have to state and arrange otherwise. Assume nothing.Asking a pretty open ended question here .

I find even though I pay a little more (sometimes) the knowledge and personal attention my supply yard gives me, saves me a ton of headaches and in turn money. They are a huge part of my operation. 

I also found that specializing is when I really started making more money. You get tooled up for it, your guys get good at it and your sales show your expertise, which a client can smell right away. Allows you to be higher priced because of the confidence factor. Which is huge.

"high end look" "high end material" and "high quality " are all subjective. If you disagree , tell me an example of a high end car And we can discuss further

I look at the market , customer - their requirements , targets and will try to customize . 

Also you seem to be assuming that "alternative" material is equivalent to cheap pr "fake ". Any use of a material that is innovative and meets the function/intended use will be considered an alternative use .

Hope you provide some insightful ideas to the community with out prejudice .Californiadecks said:

For 1: Its simple , its not a process which needs lots of intelligence , so I automate it via software and a virtual assistant who I pay whopping $5/hr . Ofcourse the expectation should be clear and we shouldn't expect the VA or software to be brainy. 

For 2 : can you elaborate on why it will bite my ass - so far , these were the projects with best customer satisfaction and referrals as it seems they were tired of hearing lazy and "not so bright" contractors who even didn't hear out what the customer wanted and propose functional solutions 

They were happy that I listened to them and researched/offered solutions with their intended budget and functionality . 

But ofcourse definitely getting my ass bitten is no fun...so want to be careful in future and most of all don't to be called "another stupid contractor " .

Also please add any other similar points to keep in mind . It helpsi kind of agree with the " specializing comment

or at least job selection.
its tough to turned down a job at times , but maybe sometimes we should.

truly interview your client as they are interviewing you.
if they are an extreme , anal person who you know will need extra time,or are overly detail oriented ,( which they have a right to be ) you have to implement more time on in your bid for a job like that.


plan your work , work your plan as dad used to say

maybe actually meet all the subs there at once , and talk with your foremen , and make a plan or " scope of work " with sa time line .
maybe you can shave off a few days that wayBiggest thing for us is bringing more in house. Not everybody can do that, you have to have the management in place to handle it properly. 

At this point, All trim and cabinets and most paint, most decks, cornice and standard remodeling work is going to be done in house with our personnel. There is a profit on top of the loaded cost of those hands. Used to do almost all the framing, recently started subbing it out. 

Besides standard work and the cabinet shop, we also own our own dumpsters, do a lot of our own minor grading, underground ect... we also have in house design/selection personell and are charging top dollar for that. It does set a barrier of Entry to using our services as a company, many people are not willing to pay what we charge for the design and upfront work before we actually pull the trigger on setting forms Etc.

That's fine. Just have to be willing to play the game I know you will lose four five in a row sometimes before you get back into chips.

While you can get creative and not always go the highest end route, say instead of hanging solid Timber beams from a ceiling you can make box beams and distress them. Save thousands of dollars and looks really good to anybody but a carpenter. LOL. Doesn't look bad but doesn't look like the real thing to me. It is what it is when you have a set budget and are trying to achieve a certain look.

Parade of Homes house last year some awards like usual, the floor tile was $2.75. Found an excellent deal on it, very rare but worth the extra effort for 4000 ft. Normally we just buy it out of my buddy's showroom. My normal allowance on a 7 figure home is 10 bucks a fult... tats 30k PLUS my Mark up she saved. I also charged for the lady in the office dealing with finding that tile

Windows, doors, tile underlayment, waterproofing , Windows, appliances, cabinets ect... should all have certain standards you don't drop below no matter what. In my opinion

not common , because of the litigation costs involved , but contractors went to jail on many occasions . I am sure you could find many examples if you look up . These would happen if the project cost justifies taking legal action .

Sent from my SM-G973U using Tapatalktheir windows are not terrible their installation is though

I had a customer us them and asked me why the house was drafty. Installers tore off all the exterior casing on all windows and sliding doors and just attached the new aluminum to the windows and doors. I could reach behind the aluminum and almost touch the interior casing.
I think they preinstalled the aluminum before installing the window from the exterior.

They came back 4 more times to do all of the corrections, customer wound up suing them ( she was a lawyer ) and got 50% of her money back I believe.Way, way over priced. As in a 6,000 dollar job ends up being 35,000 dollars.

I thought I read somewhere the window costs Andersen less than $30 to make no matter what sizeProbably not quite but I heard they are pretty cheap to make.Way overpriced. 
There are better windows available, esp for the money.
All I've ever seen them do is insert style installation. 
They use subs quite a bit, and if you get the good crew you can get a good install, if you get the hack crew, too bad.

Their sales people are highly incentivized to close the deal on the first visit. 

Don't sign on the first visit and they will call you back quickly with a lower price. 

It's an effective profit machine, but not the best option for the house or the homeowner. 



Sent from my SM-N960U using TapatalkHad a customer get 4 of them. They thought it would be better to go with "Andersen" on their main windows and hired me to do the others.

Sales guy showed up, in a car, without a ladder. Had to borrow the homeowner's ladder.

Price was approximately $7,000 per window, installed, with new trim.

I was 2 houses away, when they came to do the installation. 1 guy. He cut between the J channel and the window. You know, the plastic nailing strip on Andersen. Pulled the window out. Sat the new window in place. Attached it through the sides, I assume. Leaned out the window and caulked between the J channel and the new window. He also had no ladder. Extremely poor caulking job. Globbed all over the place and several gaps.
On the interior he installed pre-finished trim. Didn't fill any nail holes.

That is my only experience. I have heard a couple other customers say they got a price and it was incredibly high. I'm pretty sure one couple said $35,000 for 4 windows, but it's been a while back so I'm not positive.builditguy said:

TomI have a wall that I need to take out that is just under 17 ft. long. It goes down the center of the home on the second level. It seems as if it should be a load bearing wall, but there are 2 separate cased openings 48in. wide along that wall that do not have headers in them. It makes me wonder whether it is load bearing after all. Anyway, I want to put a hidden beam in the attic, but an engineering friend of mine recommended building a truss in the attic instead. Here is a little more info:

The roof system is stick built, so there are no manufactured / engineered trusses.The ceiling joists are on 16 in. centers as well as the rafters. There are purlin braces every 48 in. on center. The braces go to the top of the wall in question, and the ceiling joists (that are also serving as rafter ties) are nailed together over this wall. Here is a picture of the existing roof framing over the area that I am talking about:










My engineering friend suggested building a "truss" that extended over the 18 ft. span and rested on support beams on either side. The ceiling joists would be attached to this "truss" with either hurricane straps or other 2x4 blocking of some kind. Here is a picture of the type of thing he is suggesting. It's kind of like a strongback of sorts, I think:










Have any of you built anything like this before? The concept makes sense to me. He even mentioned tying the peak of the "truss" to the existing ridge beam. He thinks that would strengthen things even more. I don't think that I can get a 16 in. tall LVL into the attic to use as a normal hidden beam. With this "truss" approach, I think I could use two 2x12x20's as the bottom of the truss. It's going to be a good trick to get those in the attic also, but I think it is possible.

Any thoughts or suggestions here would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!It's load-bearing.MarkJames,

I am assuming that it is load bearing. That's why I'm trying to figure out the best way to install hidden support in the attic that can span the 18 ft. necessary. Getting a LVL in there would be nearly impossible without removing a lot of other existing framing and making the cost and time a whole lot more.derbow said:

This is out of my league, but sure looks expensive from here.What about removing a gable vent and bringing the LVL in that way? Or just cut a hole in the siding!I have done this (or similar) in the past.
Cut out enough ceiling to pass the material into the attic space. The drywall can be patched later.
Support each side with a temporary false wall.
Install the beam. Add hangers to attach the ceiling joists to the new load bearing beam.
Remove temp walls. Cash cheque.derbow said:

You are describing a "girder truss".

Such a thing needs to be designed by someone that knows what they are doing and has the proper software to do this to take into account all the various loads that would be in effect. Loads like wind loads, seismic loads, gravity loads and lateral loads. Plus design the components for attaching loads to the sides of the bottom "chord".

It can be done but is not easy.

Agreed.I would skip the built in place truss and just do the 16" LVls. You are going to have to patch sheetrock no matter what you do as you are removing a wall below the beam so push insulation to the side and cut back the ceiling as needed. If there is strapping/hangers that go under the ceiling joists you will want the new sheetrock joints to be at least 12-16" away.

On a 4/12 pitch like it looks like you have, the 18'x16" LVL laid flat will slide up in between the 16" OC ceiling joists while someone in the attic flexes it down while it is pushed up. 

You will not have to build temp walls if the beam is on top of the ceiling joists as removing the existing wall will be done after the beam and hangers are in place.Windwash said:

Sent from my SAMSUNG-SM-G920A using TapatalkThanks for the responses so far. My main concern is not "how" to do it, it is whether or not what I am planning to do will actually work. Are two 2x12x20 yellow pine enough to carry the weight by themselves, or do I need the extra support that a girder truss like I have described would provide. I would rather over build than under build. 

Another issue here is both a time deadline and cost. All the materials for the girder truss together costs less than one LVL. Patching the drywall is a given. The attic space is already tight, so most of the work will be done from underneath after the lumber gets placed in the attic.derbow said:

You must first tell us what the wieght is and what forces there will be. :laughing:Mike.
_______________Sometimes you just don't know you don't know."A smart man learns from his mistakes; a wise man learns from the mistakes of others."

www.portlandhardwoodrefinishing.comA guy could run an 18' LVL or equivalent through one end of the gable or hip and hang the ceiling joists from it. Undoubtedly more than a few purlin braces would have to be re-arranged. Also, each end of the beam would have to rest on established bearing, i.e. possibly posts sitting directly on the foundation or new footings in the basement. It is a bearing wall, but the braces almost act like trusses in a half-axxed way, that may explain why you are not seeing headers above the 48" openings. So that would be a good strategy to approach your project. However, you must bring a structural engineer into the discussion and have him design a system that will ensure you are not liable for any problems down the road. Even if there is a small crack on a different wall from, say, water intrusion, the homeowners are likely to point the finger at you. Your defense is that you did it "by the book." Also, you don't say where the project is. There are all kinds of loads to calculate, snow loads being one of them. Roofs in the south are engineered to be flimsier than roofs up north. Good luck.Sky hook. I think you kust need to carry the ceiling and the kickers. The 18 inch lvl seems excessive to me, but I am not there, nor am I an engineerFirst off what these guys are trying to tell you is"your in over your head". You have mentioned twice that you have been talking to "your friend " the engineer.Why not let him figure it out? You will need stamped drawing to get a permit for this anyhow.
You are getting a permit aren't you? One last piece of advice form me.Make sure your insurance is paid up.There are no prescriptive truss designs. This will have to be engineered. Also, regarding whether a couple 2X12s could be used as a beam for an 18' span - no.

It's pretty clear you have no idea how long it would take to build this yet-to-be-engineered truss in place in an attic. I'll give you the answer - way too long. Same answer for a box beam.

Go to your yard and see if they'll size an LVL for you for free, and get a good set of plans.

This is structural engineering, not really general handyman stuff.

PS, I don't believe you have a structural engineer buddy, or he wouldn't have gone down that path. LVL is going to be cheaper and faster overall, unless your time is free.I just purchased my first home :thumbup: and want to open the kitchen up into the living room with only having an 8ft by 10 ft kitchen :sad:.

We apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused. This thread has been closed.For appearance sake I'd like to frame and wallboard and finish smooth this box portion that runs along the entire length of the basement (about a fifty foot run, broken by a wall and utility room area). 

From a maintenance standpoint, T-Bar is best for everything. Given the plumbing connections right above (and wiring). But every drop ceiling that I can ever recall noticing leaves the steel column raw, "as is" (like in pic - column featured is ours). I take it, for reasons of framing/attachment. 

The box will extend roughly 5 ft wide to conceal the gas furnace exhaust pipes.

While we'd like to keep it high as possible...any ideas to a great looking drop section and column casing?

Rest of house/bordering is all basic colonial mould and 6 panel doors.

Would like to put in a free hanging vertical section, to avoid that "metal banded" look at the corner. So there's only the flat horizontal acoustic upper and lower ceilings in view. 

Where can I get kit metal to do this? (copper pipes run close to the upper outer corner) It looks like a squarish "J" section would fit, but where to get the stock pieces that can be modified to fit?Unless there are dampers, shutoffs, or electrical junctions, I would definitely drywall the duct area.

Which is why I'm trying to at least drywall a seperator.

There is plumbing above, a full bath at one end, a partial at the other and also a laundry room with drain.

This is a 6 to 7 ft wide box to the wall. Runs more than half the length of the basement.

That dark grey pvc in-between the copper and whitish furnace exhaust lines, is for the central vac that's getting moved. The distance between the copper and that bigger exhaust line narrows, to maybe an inch to an inch-and-a-half - so either ripping studs down to box frame to the joists or a metal kit, might fit in there better.

Needing to cut down on the size of the giant box...
.Any ideas for a synthetic, ("plastic"), sheet for partition walls/ceilings in a warehouse?

I think you will find trying to beat the cost of drywall hard.
Not just the purchase price but the install and any future repair costs.
Most sheet plastics need some kind of substrate or if it's thick enough it costs a bundle, 4x8 sheet $140.00 
Keep in mind these sheets can get scared or scratched easily.

No machinery on site?Weight is roughly 2540lbs. It is an interior wall so i haven't thought of a good way to hoist it in using machinery.Jacks, cribbing and manpower.Maybe a couple of these rented and rated for a little more than this model, or three of them.

I have to ask, have you done any calculations on what is required for this, and the weight you will be supporting? Deflection of the beam taken into account? 

Getting it in may be the least of your concerns. You have to shift the load to the beam when in place, I assume. And brick is not forgiving of any movement.

Oh hell no, not for 2540lbs beam. 

A 'normal' cabled proctor wall jack not extended might be in range to lift half, but that's past the 1000lbs load rating. Cables rated around 3000lbs, the ratchet lift assemble would be the weak link.

That said, I installed very carefully and added counter flash on top of flange onto studs before hardi. Then when I liquid waterproofed I taped along the tub a 1/4" past the hardi. Once I rolled the hydroban I essentially had an L flash from the hardi to the tub.Back in the day Kohler used a rubber tile flange add on.

I had a job where I declined to do it that way...The plastic flange was like $30 to $40, and that didn't sound too reassuring for the open plan ceiling downstairs. 

Today, I'd have more confidence...and block behind the entire lip area, sealing it up for extra assurance.I had a similar situation where the HO wanted to reuse the old tub that didn't have a flange. I ended up running the backer board to just above the tub. I then filled the gap with Kerdi-Fix and applied some Kerdi-Band over that. I have recently heard concern that Kerdi-Fix may not be fully waterproof (knock on wood it's not that bad). If I had to do it again, I would probably use Wedi or Sika sealant instead of the Kerdi-Fix.Thanks for the responses, I told my client to switch to an alcove tub and told the "designer" to stick to picking wallpaper and paint colors.

I did the tile backsplash a few weeks ago and am just getting to installing the rangehood. I noticed as soon as I walked in today they the outlet is dead centered on the stove. I wish I'd noticed it during tiling but I guess I assumed it was in the right spot. The rangehood plug doesnt have a chance of fitting once the ducting is in so I have my electrician meeting me there Thursday to hopefully move the box over a few inches. 

Before I start cutting tiles I thought I'd see if anyone has run into this and found a work around or has any ideas that might save some headache. As is, even flexible ducting wouldn't work with the plug. Thanks guysSee if a clock outlet will work.What range hood has a plug? and how are you going to keep that accessible ?rrk said:

Does it have to be with the plug or just on a dedicated circuit?If the range hood will cover it, just direct wire it instead. I'm guess the wire is in the right spot, but it wasn't supposed to be a receptacle.My guess is it should be a whip to connect into the hoods J box.

dedicated circuit is not the issue, connection has to be accessible, plug or whip

Its like burying a splice box

now you either have to have that box accessible, run a new wire or find a wire stretcherProbably is in the correct spot but wasn't meant to be an outlet.Definetly not meant to be hardwired. It comes with a grounded plug that is located inside the stainless steel "chimney". 

There is no where for the wire to exit short of drilling a 1" hole somewhere in the metal. I understand the concern about it being buried but I have installed one like this before with the same instructions. The chimney can be removed with a few screws so possibly that makes the outlet accessible, much like a junction box above ceiling tiles? Although I do understand they should be "accessible without any special tools or knowldge"

Its is a CMT r450sssebg. For anyone interested this video shows the installation of what appears to be the same unit but branded differently. Skip to 3:30 to see how the electrical connection is made. It doesnt show him actually plugging it in because he probably ran into the same problem...

I was thinking that too. Running a lath up the wall and create a space for water that gets behind to drain. Wasn't sure if this is the greatest practice though.I just did a search on" water drain house wrap", and there are some products that came up that just might work for you.Thanks, Randy. I the product you probably came across. Looks like something that could be very beneficial I choose this application.I'm sure the HO wants to go back with a similar look, I'm dealing with an HOA for a 6 unit waterfront complex that's given the green light to change the diagonal look (early 90's look) that's failed for horizontal siding because of the inherent issues with diagonal siding. 

the most troubling part I would think would be the joints between the runs of diagonal hardie. Is there anyway to not have joints (ie the runs are less than 12' or 16')? If not, the recommended method of putting a piece of felt behind the joint wouldn't be sufficient, it would be better to overlap the joint with something like Z-trim. 

The rain screen they use for cedar installations might help too. Benjamin Obdyke is a manufacturer to look at.Hey Guys, I took a look at a bathroom today for a injured Vet. They want to Reno the main bathroom in the house to make it more assessable for him. 

Main think that is needed is to replace the tub with a barrier free shower. What I am stuck on is the best was to achieve that. The bathroom is 5ft wide by 10ft deep with the tub at the far end.

I never thought about having the drain at the threshold. I always dirta my bathrooms and Keri the overlaps so I would just need to Kerdi up behind the baseboards. Is it worth adding a floor drain elsewhere in the bathroom also?https://builddaley.com/This is small enough you can consider going euro and have the whole floor tiled with drain.Stunt Carpenter said:

The long linear drains are quite expensive. Bad pic but here's one I did. No door, no lip. No water gets past the drain, though I did slope the first 12" wide row after the drain 1/4"You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.Lower shower floor area by 3/4" by sistering 2x4 joist 3/4" lower that existing joist, cut plyood to fit in between existing joist and sits on top of lower 2x4's. 

Put linear drain at threshold to shower and water proof up walls under base trim with kerdi or similar. 

Or use www.vimproducts.com they have a center drain location and pan can be cut down, have to use smaller tiles though. It uses same process of lowering shower floor like I mentioned above.Stunt Carpenter said:

I agree with lowering the floor in the shower area.

A drain in the shower ( linear preferred) and a linear just outside the threshold to catch any errant water.

If you do add a drain out in the floor area consider adding a trap primer to keep odors at bay.Very timely thread. I am starting a master bedroom and bathroom addition on my Grandma's house in a couple of weeks. The shower needs to be barrier free, in anticipation of future mobility issues.

Would you guys recommend framing the bathroom floor as usual, then cutting the joists down like above, or would it be easier to frame only the shower area alone lower than the rest of the bathroom right form the get-go?www.alchemyconstruction.coI'd frame it to suit the plan.

i would prefer to frame in the drop down rather than cut joists.

greater latitude to get the depth you want.

cut joists seem to get extra attention from inspectors.If the vet is in a wheel chair do not do a single slope pain. Use the Schluter LT or TT pan. My preferance is the LT. 

I inset the pans. I had to double and triple joists for the tub, so the notching is not a big deal.

TomA client would like some 4x4 posts removed from their first floor garage. The entire first floor was a garage for a plumbing operation and had a ton of shelving and storage space. The posts are against a wall in the row home with the adjoining homes wall on the other side. The 4x4s have inch holes for tubing to hold longer pipes and materials. The marks on the wall look like there was some shelving built around the bottom as well. It has since been remodeled and a ceiling and hvac put in. Most of the posts are loose and movable. They are bracketed into the concrete floor, but the ceiling is a little iffy... there are l brackets, but they do not have bolts and are not attached to the ceiling. They don’t make any sense as a load bearing component, but wanted an opinion from someone who has some solid understanding. Thanks for the input!

one walls is still original. its about 6 feet x 8 feet high .

they want it smooth 
i`ve used both materials , but no really an expert at either .
definitely used joint compound much more , and can get things smooth.
i`ve used one- coat , but its been a while , and if i remember you can keep working it , and sponge it as it hards and get it smooth also 
what you use? one-coat , or joint compound ?can you just sheet the area with, drywall, plywood, siding, etc?

seems like the labor savings would be worth it.Use 1.5" fur strips every 16 inches and scribe/shim them so the wall is flat then hang drywall on them.

Most times, the best approach plays to your strengths, or at least avoids weaknesses.You can get a 5" wet concrete polisher and make that stucco as smooth as finish as Granite if they want. Since it's a wall, I'd image they just want it to be smooth not necessarily polished. The same tool could accomplish that.Removed by staffDoes anyone have any experience with iron entry doors?

I miss talking shop with him. Glad to have found this sight a while back . So thanks in advance for your input. picture should be next. I know its hard to everything from a photo but the drain ties into laundry room drain and vent which is right below and on other side of wallsince i was cut off from responding to those that chimed in on other thread i would like to say thanks. I realize what should have been done IE: blocking in or framing in a plumbing box.but it wasn't and obviously i feel lots of mistakes made but not going to point fingers I really just wanted to now how you would go about correcting now. Single of mother of 5 kids is the customer and budget in tight. that being said has anyone any thoughts on metal strapping used to reinforce joist that got hacked? seems that would help solve my problem with out reworking the plumbing. I am not asking what should have been done but now im looking for how to solve problem. the metal strapping does anyyone know the gauge ? I have only seen a couple of timesI found this strapping after last post and would like to know if any other "pro" has used and thought web sight is www.nolan-engineering.com or instafooting.com. I will not solve the issue with the shower drain but i think i can deal with that another way and then I will be able to use but would like opinions. Thanks again to those that respond in advance.

Try and remember topic and clear your mind of other and you may see differentlyThe easiest and cheapest thing to do, obviously, is to leave it as it is.

Frankly, if it is not causing any real works problems at this time then it may never cause a problem. I would like to be able to have an engineered solution for it but let's be real here. If the customer can't afford it then she can't afford it.

I wanted to do blocking too and double joist and blocking but if sistering full length of joist may not need blocking. btw no joist on toilet side as that is where pitch of roof changes from a hip still to a gable roof . strapping blocking was answer i was wanting just not sure if best . I like all opinions and know not one answer is always the only answer to some extent.If you sister a joist against the existing joists with the holes, aren't you still going to have to put holes/notches in the sisters? The holes/notches will still be oversized for prescriptive holes/notches. Unless you cut the plumbing and drop it into a soffit you can frame on the garage ceiling.

3 inch round hole not 6 inch square hole and shower 2 in (maye be able to solve shower drain issue with off set ) a 12 joist and not within 1/2 inch at top of joist would be ideal i was hoping to use the strapping to but maybe too much to ask from strapping just a pita to cut and redo plumbing to soffit into wall where it ties in is way more plumbing to do so not as simple but again if hole drilled correctly down from the top 1/2 in to 3inches down 4 inch allowed on a 12 in right?ScipioAfricanus said:

if strapping like the one i listed i would strap above the toilet drain to reinforce top portion of joist i was thinking on side like manufacture of strapping showedI think that you would be better off strapping the underside of the joists rather than the top.

Andy.https://andytardif.wixsite.com/websitehere is what i was referring to look at around 9.34 minute markI’m putting in a half bathroom and I’m having a problem with toilet draining. To get the right flow there’s no way around it we have to drill through the floor joists for the toilet drain pipe. The pipes are 3 inch pvc. We have to drill through 6 or 7 of the joists. The floor joists are a weird 3 inch thick by 6 inches wide. They are roughly 20-22 inches apart and they run 8 ft long to the center giant IBeam that looks like it was meant for a bridge. How can I reinforce these beams or add support so that I can put in the 3 inch holes? There has to be a way but 6 inch wide joists (5.75 inches) does not seem wide enough to accommodate a 3 inch hole. I mean they are 3 inches thick (2.75 actual)

I can attach pictures later if needed.Hire an engineer.With slope you'll have less than 1" of meat on the joists. You'll have to run under and soffit it in. Very likely no way around it.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.I know where I am there's no way I'm getting a permit to cut that much out of floor joists. With that being said, We did a job where we went through ten inch joists with three inch pipes and we had 1/4 inch steel plates fabbed up with all the holes predrilled for the pipe and bolts that we impacted on either side of the joists. IDK dude, that way too much wood out of a joist. Iirc my local code is no more than a 20 % or something like that.Golden view said:

Click to expand...

Engineered steel reinforcers if you have a lot of cash lying around to burn.It's a basic code question. Holes have to be a minimum of 2" from the top or bottom of the joist, and no more than 1/3 the depth.

Run it above the joists, below the joists, or get an engineered solution for running it through the joists.There's all kinds of options. You just need to find one.

Welcome to the world of remodeling.

You can run the pipe between the joists, and down a wall. (Usually the best way)

You can hire an engineer and then a fab shop to make some fancy pieces of steel, if you want to go the expensive route.

You can box it in, as was suggested.

You can drop the entire ceiling.

You can elevate the WC and install a tank and sewage ejector, and run it up through the attic.

You can relocate the bathroom.

Lots of options. But drilling those joists ain't one. :thumbsup:Building Contractor

but i took it on the chin
, and re-skimmed the whole bathroom , and re-primed and painted .

but to pull off the outlet covers , and look behind them ??
your telling me , i`m trying to " sneak by" ?

you`ve never had one of those over the top OCD clients , who just could never be satisfied?? so that means i`m sneaking by imperfections?

i stuck it out, till he said " looks great"On new builds, production, the drywall hangers get stupid with their routers.

Sparky comes along, sometimes can jockey the switch or outlet enough to cover the wild cuts. Sometimes not.

That's where the drywall spotter comes on, knifes to the outlet cover, makes it look pretty. And even still, at walk through, there may be a few shadows the customer may spot, so the punch out guy fixes them.

But never, no not ever, have I allowed a customer to pull a cover and complain about what he/she finds.

Ain't happening.They make extra large plate covers. When having some new boxes cut in during a remodel, they're a sign of sloppy work.

Wall plates, crown, base, cabinets do not come off for a skim inspection 

There are actual inspection standards, point them out and use them.Use an inspection light. If You can get something to look good under a light - even look "ok" under a light, then it's going to look really good under normal lighting conditions.woodspike said:

I have an OCD client was warned not to work for her by another client, I've been working for her for nearly 30 years. I know what her expectations are, everything has to be perfect as possible, jobsite has to be spotless.

She called me said "I moved some pictures on the walls" Me "Okay?" Her "Well there's nail holes behind the pictures".

Everyone knew how bad she was it meant constant referrals for me. While I'm more of a perfectionist than most of my clients some just request odd things.

I was asked once not to finish painting one corner of a room. "Why?" The response "Because it reminds me that my father told me nothing is perfect in life".

Reminds me of a PITA customer I had that complained about an imperfection in the ceiling. Couldn't see anything in the two trips I made and they couldn't see it either.
Then he calls me and says come out between 6:45 and 7:00 PM when the sun is starting to set. You can see it in that time frame. Not before and not after.

Yeah right.Trump-The "Con Man's" Con Man.Think I mentioned this before. Customer sent me a video on a Saturday night at 11pm of a Miter dripping once every 10 seconds during a heavy rain storm. . 

Then a few weeks ago he sent me a pic of a bay window with an old ass flat roof where the paint was peeling under one of the miters and said the gutter is leaking and causing damage to his window and frame. Then he preceded to mention that I said I guaranteed my work and it needed to be addressed. 

I sent him a pic of the day I completed the job of the area he pointed out with the same amount of paint peeling and told him the roof should have been replaced 40 years ago. He sent me another email and asked if I could recommend a roofer 


Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkGot A client that I did a budget kitchen for years ago. Gave them a good price because they were recommended by my best client and they were moving out of the house very soon. So 7 years later they moved out of the house 

And they asked me to build them a new kitchen. But they needed it now, I needed to start right away. I declined because I was busy. And they never got back to me. I gave them my schedule and said I could do it after that then actually declining. They never responded back.

Then the emailed again saying they went with the GCs kitchen guy, which was expected, they needed a kitchen if I couldn't do it someone else would.

The apologized for not responding back to me and said they had a few other built ins they wanted made. Again I'm swamped and I gave them a detailed schedule of the work I had to complete before I could get to them and I didn't give a date, only how long I thought it would take for me to complete these projects and let them figure out the math.

They didn't respond.

Today, 3 weeks late they have emailed me. It's sitting in my email box unopened.

There's lots and lots of things you can do, but you'd have to differentiate what you're going to do yourself versus paying someone... design is fun but once you get past the looks of something, it's the function that really matters and whether or not it's working for you...

As an example, if you guys love to cook, your kitchen would be designed with that in mind, but if it's more utilitarian, there are some things that look good in a pic but that you're probably not going to use that much, so is really more wasted money than anything else...

Another example is in the bathroom... we designed a side drawer compartment to be able to access feminine products from the side of the cabinet on the toilet side instead of having to do the reach-around the door stretch...

IMO, for a remodel job to be worth it in the end all three components must be considered.

Exactly why not everyone is cut out to be a remodeler.Pay someone else to do it....Everybody has their thing. I like it easy to clean. 

I don't like stuff in counters, so drop down or pop up kitchen appliances. I also hate wandering around when cooking. Ideally I could keep one foot in place and pivot to get what I need. Galley kitchen layout works best for that.Hot water hose bibb outside.

Outdoor shower.

Tile kitchen. Hardwood sucks in a kitchen. The water eventually ruins it.

A "control room" with screens for all the IR, Thermal and HD cameras, auto gate controller, remote control for the machine gun nest, and remote unlock for the kennels. :blink:

Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalklighting, plumbing, flooring, hardware etc can be covered with allowances.

now what you have to be careful about is to provide a realistic allowance for what your clients want as far as brand, style & quality.

no low balling, you need to have a realistic expectation as to what they want.

another thing to keep on top of is to have decisions made in a very timely manner, hopefully before you start construction.

communication & education are vital....Exactly what Griz said! I always put in an allowance for things that the client will be picking and try to give a fair allowance on those items. You have to judge your clientele to get a feel for their budget and taste and also explain that's where they can save or blow the budget depending on their selections.gutted this bathroom . done tons of these over the years .
we`re at the point now where the tile guy just finished his tile in the shower.
after he finished , i came in , and saw the tile went from flush to the wall on the bottom , to a full inch our on the top.
he leveled the tile as he should , 
apparently . the existing wall was off plumb a full inch top to bottom.
so now i have to re-do that wall 
too much to float out 
so i`m gonna take the drywall out , and re-level that wall from where the tile ends.

its 5 feet of wall to the corner.
its an older house 
but i kind of feel i should have checked the wall for this 
on the flip side 
client is acting as her own contractor . i`m the carpenter sub on this job ( usually i`m the coordinator).
i`ve endured electric that had to be re-done , and a/c vent ,installed in the wrong place 
exhaust fan i had to hook up because electrician forgot to.
she really hasn`t coordinated anything, but i can`t really throw that in her face if i want to stay in good graces

unfortunately , homeowners working as their own contractor aren`t appreciative of the extra work you have to sometimes do.
they just think everyone is incompetent 


should i charge for this , or just shut up ?
i really do care about call-backs and referralsI'd probably eat it or blame the tile guy. It sounds the tile should have followed that old wall a bit closer, or the issue should have been called out and addressed earlier.

On the other hand, if client is running the job and you had no control on this, then certainly bring it up and a "what happened here??" and try to get something for the extra work and materials. But do it all with a smile, like you're still on their side.I always thought the carpenter was responsible for getting framing ready for drywall, tile, whatever is going there. If a corner shower was going in, you'd make sure the corner was framed plumb and square. Tile has it's own requirements.

This is just part of the normal scope for me. If I have to bring in Tipi to shim an entire wall and floor, that's just a normal part of it.Unless they paid you to correct existing house problems you can charge them. An inch out of level is an existing house problem and needs shimming out. That isn't a normal building procedure, it's a correction procedure. And unless you discussed that you would make everything perfect in the house I would expect you to charge something for it.

But now that the tiling is done and you see the problem when did you know it was out of level by one inch? If you knew at the beginning and you didn't say to the client "Do you want this fixed, it's going to affect the tiling" then I think you're going to have to eat anything that has to be ripped out and redone. If this is a get it done cheap job and they are calling you out for not doing a perfect job, then it's on them and they are looking for champagne when they paid for beer.The Tree of Liberty needs watering

there will be a glass shower door, so he did technically do it correctly

yea 
he did thinset it out the full inch.

ha!:laughing: i did go friday , tried to start floating the wall out. i had 2 bags of 20 minute mud . didnt put put a dent in it .
i`ll just cut it all out, and start over 

client is a pretty nice lady also. 
she is a foster mom , has 6-8 kids there.
their pretty well off .
i just hate when they try to save a buck , but don`t do their part.
also designer , is doing all by phone 
come by now and then , and do your job !!
i stopped by twice , while the tile guy was working just to see how things were going .
, and i had no obligation to , just habit .You can charge her for squaring up the wall because that's extra. But not to rip out tile and re-tile after the fact. You should've checked all the framing to be ready for tile. Imo

_______________Mike.
_______________I’ve never heard of a tile guy building thinset up to an inch thick to make up for out of plumb walls, maybe a little deeper bed for a wavy wall but they generally don’t get to worked up over out of plumb or out of square walls. Glass getting cut at 1” out of square over 7-8’ is not uncommon. You should be ashamed of your wall but the tile guy should be ashamed of his work as well.woodspike said:

Yup, it's the cost of a phone call.

I once did a bathroom renovation in which we had left a large wall mirror above the vanity in place. The tile guy installed the tile wainscot and left me with a 6' wedge of wall between the tile and the mirror, that went from about 1/2" to nothing, left to right (so the mirror was off for years). Never gave me the courtesy of a heads up, and argued why he was right because his line was level, and the client got to see it first. The best is that the client insisted I use that sub, per her designer. 

(Btw, the solution was a piece of chrome applied to the bottom of the mirror to cover the gap.)rrk said:

https://www.hpcfire.com/blog/entry/...t-remember-heat-rises-part-3-of-a-series.htmldone it maybe 20 times 
but , after a while with anything i`ve done repetitively for years , i wonder " is there a better way"
this floor has only gone down maye 3/8 of an inch.
not because of plumbing , but a/c leaking.
but its been dried out ,( with dehumidifier)
no rot.
very nice old lady , and i even told her she really doesn`t need it right away , or ever , but 
she said she`d feel better doing it anyway.
i usually let them know i cant bring it back up much , if any , 
without maybe causing damage to plumbing or the tiles in the bathroom right next to this room ( original bathroom in a 1930`s house.
this crawl space is only about 24 inches plus or minus
so i`ll support whats there ( again its maybe 3/8 drop , can`t even see any bowing , or difference. with all the other beams.right next to the drain for the tub, and toilet ( cast iron) , , and that looks good!.
first off , i pull a plastic tarp under there , and spread it out as best as possible , so i`m crawling on theat , instead of the 70-80 year old dirt.i have a couple fluorescent lights i`ve rigged with plugs , and set them in there , so its well lit.
i get those 4 inch thick x 20 x20 concrete slabs , and put them in place where needed ( making sure the ground is tight.
i use a cross-member like a 4x6 p.t. to support 4 or 5 joists .
then i use those adjustable floor jacks . they sell them different sizes.
adjust them tight.
then i`ll use a floor ( or bottle) jack , and push a little further , since it forces better than the jacks ,
then re-adjust the jacks tight again .
then inside , i`ll replace the 1/4-round molding she has so she doesn't see the gap anymore.
again , it seems to work , but how many of us really go back 5-10 years later to see if what we did was the best way, and that it held?

any ADVICE?
( worse phrase i hear from old carpenters is :" i`ve done it this way 30 years , i`ve never had any complaints !!" .:laughing:
i don`t have that ego . at 60 , i`ll still google millwork , and door install ( did my first door at 16 years old, and installed molding that young too), , i re-check everything to make sure i`m doing it the right/best wayIf it's going to settle, it could take a year to start moving, depending on conditions.

Even checking to see if any jacks went a little slack after a month is worthwhile, most of the time this is disturbed soil so settling is a real possibility.yea . thanks

i just remembered , that ,i should make a point to let her know i should come back out in 6 months or so , and re-tighten those jacks if need beWhat type of jack do you keep under there? Screw jacks?
I usually just shim if it is on the outside, or add a post and beam if it is in the middle.

Jack it1/8 to 1/4 inch high, set post and beams, then lower back down. It's as permanent as the original build was.

I do like the idea of leaving the jacks though, so it can be adjusted later. Though, Ibusually dig down to solidish ground before dropping my pad in.

Those are big pads to drag under a house.

these support posts are only about $30-$50 each , " Tiger brand "

but like i said , you can tell client to call you in 6 months or a year , and you can go under and give each one a turn or 2 , incase things have settled

Then another guy would come by with a giant lambs wool glove and slather a thicker mixture over the whole thing. quite a messy operation. At that time it looked more lake layers of corrugated cardboard.I figured it probably was, but it's a different texture than what I've seen in the past. There's about 5' of it on a cold water line. No idea why it's there. Thanks.Home Designer Series SoftwareWell new one to me, started a new remodel of master bathroom, opened floor and found 2x10 joists spaced 12" o/c span 16' 10 1/2"

Doing tile over ditra heat membrane with nu heat cables. Freestanding tub with 90 gallons. Engineer wants to put a beam mid span, we have expansive soils so that means cutting or jack hammer into slab in finished basement. 

I suggested hanging one end of beam off foundation wall or bolting post to wall. 

Anyone have any other good ideas? 

Client is aware the span is way too much I came up with L300. Impossible to sister full length, adding plywood I don't think will help bending or deflection of joist itself.Is there room to sister? It's not as crazy long of a span as it sounds. The low end BCI/TGI joists calc out ok. LVLs surely would.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.No way to sister, too many things in floor and no way to get the joists into house. Contacted a few helical pier companies and see what I can do versus having them do it all.How old is the house, is there a grade stamp on the joists? Are you calculating deflection with #2 lumber?You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.The sizing of the joists is well within prescriptive limits, no worries. If you want to stiffen the floor you don't have to sister the joists by going 100% of the length of the existing joists.
Sistering them about 85% of the length would work just fine. 
It is just my opinion but I think it would stiffen the floor as much as you need.

I can't sister anything now as I installed plumbing etc...my mistake, should have waited to hear from engineer. 

Cant even go 50% with sistering. 

I don't know the species or grade of joists house built in 1974.I recently checked 2x10 span for something. If I recall the book maxed them out at 15'10" 16 o/c. So your going a foot longer and reducing the o/c. Without out looking it's got to be close to Max.

Yeah my other engineer coming out tomorrow, used this guy in past but was too busy a year or so ago to come look at a project. Every which way I run numbers, chart spans etc...

I am pulling drywall ceiling below for him to assess everything. This guy has 30 years experience and has helped me with some real head scatchers. 

Big problem is our expansive soils, bentonite have to float basement walls makes putting a post in hard as hell in finished basement. 

17 godamn feet....WTF...Yeah, the AWC give Doug Fir #2 an elastic Modulus of about 1,600,000 which when you run the numbers gives you a span of about 20' for your application.
The other charts are conservative in the extreme with an elastic modulus of about 1,000,000 1,200,000.
If your AHJ allows for interpolation of the IRC then you are just barely good to go with your application as is.

That is my opinion anyway.

Welcome back. :thumbup:Okay exposed the joist they are DF #2 found a stamp on couple joists. 

Licensed Engineer, I have used before, came out and so far has speced a double 9 1/2" LVL beam 11' wide, one end will bear on step foundation footer I exposed, no problem there. 

Other side he proposed an adjustable steel monopost 3" OD bearing on slab in wall that is 11' away from other end in exterior wall. Bathroom is 90" wide and that is where I am calculating 60 lbs per sq ft over the 8'x17' area. 

He seems to think the slab and soil which is expansive in our area will support the 2,200 lbs each post will need to support. Slab is 45 yrs old and I am assuming not reinforced. 

My gut tells me to open floor 12" x 12" x 12" deep and do a pad under monopost for my peace of mind. Both rooms in basement are finished, the one I exposed the ceiling in is a work zone now. 

Thoughts?Is that 2200 lbs per post or 1100 per post?

Edit: I see where it says per post.

Slab appears solid in all places. My big concern is our expansive soils very wet years it swells, droughts shrinks and can move a ton of weight. 

To me it seems a no brainer to do it now versus after if tile cracks and then floor heat has to come up as well. 

Half day now versus 1 week down the road. 

The slab may hold fine, what if it doesn't. 

Would you do it?a 12x12" footing is quite possibly less strong than the 45 year old reinforced slab. That's a tiny footing. It'll have a cold joint to the slab and it's on the same expansive soils.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.Well you consulted an engineer and anything you do beyond his beliefs is extra safe so go for it. Its bugging you and it would me too, just 1 event is very costlyOk I am tasked with removing this tub. It is on first floor drywalled ceiling in basement bathroom below tub. I am also removing the tile and raised framing deck. I am guessing 400 lbs. 

Slede o matic is my go to with alcove cast iron which I believe this tub is also cast iron. 

Disconnect drain, remove floor tiles, and use some pry bars to get it out of hole prior then bashing it up. 

Concern about bashing it in place is damage to ceiling below which I warned them about. 

I have 3 guys plus me and a bunch of pry bars including 8' long thick hex one. 

Anyone for bashing it in place?Depends. If it's going to be on TV, go for it. :laughing:

Otherwise, I'd pull it first. Especially with that much manpower available.I would be inclined to remove it one piece. 4 guys, levers, blocks. Post it on craig with a pic and you might get lucky unloading it for a $100. Or drop it off at a Restore.Cover it with moving blankets first, if you plan on busting it out.


Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkMy advice is to figure out the order in which it was installed, and just reverse the order. Unless it's a cast iron tub, leave the sledge out of the mix.220...221...whatever it takes!Bust it up, it will take less than 1hr to get that out by yourself, start with the sides and work your way down unless you want to sit there and play with it and at the end you end up doing the same thing.

You can also use Cast Iron cutting reciprocating saw blade but it will take longer.

That says, even if you cause a disturbance to the ceiling below all you will have is a few nails-pops which is nothing to touch it up.I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​Pull the over flow, verify it's cast iron.

4 guys, disconnect drain, see if you can wedge it up off the deck with shims at the rim edge, if not it's probably mortared in place. 

If you can wedge to up 4 guys should be able to carry it out, if not, score with grinder, cover, break, remove.

TomVerify it's cast, pry it out. see if you can carry it out. You have enough labor there to do it unless they're really useless. Why risk making more work for yourself? At most there was four guys to carry that sucker in so it could come out the same way.tjbnwi said:

Won't be real heavy since there is no apron, looks like a early 90s kohlerI will be there couple days prior to demo to put down ramboard, hepa scrubbers, magnetic door set up etc... my plan is to pull overflow and drain shoe and check if cast iron, pretty sure it is and then see if I can use my burke bar to see if I can move it a little. Planning on using shims to support rim and then pull it out. 

I think it is the Kohler tub which shouldn't be terribly heavy but sucks being sunkened to get it out of the hole.

thanksman , i`ve hit them before with a sledge hammer , and it bounces off if you don`t hit it just right .
then it shatters like glass if it gets hit hard , and right .

grinder works great , just dusty / dirty.
it might be sitting in a bed of cement , and that might be mended to it.

Good point on the cement, I've bedded them in mortarCame out nice in one piece and carried to dumpster, about 400 lbs give or take. Hardest part was getting it out of hole, rotated it on side and then carried to garage laid it back up right and carried 4 corners to dumpster. 

No mortar under it, plywood sub base under tub.

Reverse engineering things when possible is the best. If you would have broken that thing up, you'd probably still be there vacuuming all the pieces out of the carpeting everywhere you all stepped all day. When you have to bust those things up it's just a bad mess, but sometimes there are no options. Glad to hear it came out fine.220...221...whatever it takes!I have a project coming up where I need a 36" wide x 60" long curbless shower linear drain install. 

Problem is shower is open on one side and along front limiting pan thickness.

I have looked at Arc trudeck, too small of a pan 32x51, Wedi and Kerdi both would be too thick and need a curb along one side which client may be ok with. I have used VIM center drain but client wants big tiles. 

Any others out there that would work? 

I am planning on removing sub floor, cleating joists etc... so I have 3/4" recess. Rest of floor will get ditra heat and Nuheat cables.Locating the drain on the long outside wall?

You can do a center drain with large format, just have to cut the "hip" tiles.

Are you heating the shower floor?

If you're not heating the shower floor use the 76x38x 1-5/8 Schluter pan, by the time you trim off the 2" you'll be at 1-9/16, add the heat mat height to the bathroom floor and you're at approx 1-1/8" height, slice the balance off top of the pan, cover cut area with Kerdi. 

Make sure you install a wicking barrier between the pan area and main floor. I use Dilex expansion strip.

Easy peezey.

https://www.schluter.com/schluter-us/en_US/ShowerTrays

TomHey Tom was hoping you would chime in. No heat on shower floor as I think that may build it too much with addition of ditra heat membrance on top of pan. 

Best choice for them would be valve wall location. My choice would be at long back wall versus glass door. 

I was looking at the 76x38 as it seems to be the best choice as I think your correct that by the time I cut it down to 60x36 I would lose enough thickness to be close and could shave down pan and cover with Kerdi. 

thanks!If you're going shower valve wall, you'll need the 36x72 not the 76x38. By the time you trim it to 60" it will be 2" tall. 

This job is in Highlands Ranch.

Show them these pictures, you can see the pitch and how it interacts with the room floor. I don't uses the Schluter trim for this, I cut the pitch on the tile. You have to start at the low point, this means trimming the tile on the level floor. 

The gray line at the exit of the shower is the Dilex I used for the wicking barrier.

This shower floor is heated. I use Ditra Heat cable. 

TomAs I mentioned large format is possible. 

First photo is my work (8x8 is not really large format by definition), the other two are used with permission of the installers. 

TomAgain, using with permission.

Nice work!

How deep is the recess for the pan? Looks deeper than 3/4 for some reason. 

All in all it seems easiest choice would be the 76x38 as it is thinner and puts drain at back wall.It is deeper than 3/4. I used the 36x72 pan to get the drain at the mixing valve wall. Probably 1-1/4". Trimmed the joist and doubled where necessary, due to the 72" tub and joist span I had to double up others anyways. 

TomSo it seems pan is 7/8" thick at drain body edge of pan so I think I can put drain at door and raise drain body 5/8" or so to match field tiles. That sound about right?Give Rod Katwyk a shot. He is the king of custom foam pans. Actually the king of custom foam anything.

It was about 2 weeks for the Douglas county permit for the job I posted the pictures of. They wanted an arc fault breaker on the heat floor, problem was it's a 2 pole floor circuit which does not require an arc fault.

Seems that the thread has stalled or even ended (Kevin got his answer?) so I’m going to take it in a slightly different direction.

As many know, here in Colorado, we deal with different building department authorities in just about every county, city, town and even some neighborhoods. Tom mentioned Douglas County as having no clue, but the reality is that I don’t think many of the various authorities have a clue... and it pisses me off!

Can we discuss what we believe to be the minimum requirements of a barrier free shower? I would simply like to get a feel for what you guys think gets passed.I love what I do and I'm very good at it!

Da Vinci on the web or Da Vinci On FacebookUpdate: I ended up with adding a curb opposite of valve wall and putting linear full width tileable drain at door. Recessed area like the drawing and approved by Wheat Ridge who are a total PITA to get permit. 

Head guy is great front office gal has an attitude and don't dare ask her about permitting questions even though her job is Permit Technician. They have 1.5 star rating for good reason. :laughing:

I was reading Schluter literature about drains at shower door entrance and they recommend the closed and or tileable drains only. 

If KERDI-LINE is placed at shower entrance,
it is recommended that grate assembly A or
the covering support is chosen and that the
drainage openings span the maximum width
of the entrance to limit potential overflow;
secondary drainage (e.g., KERDI-DRAIN) may
be required in the drying area. page six https://sccpublic.s3-external-1.ama...7a/8939211030558/Shower System Data Sheet.pdfDaVinciRemodel said:

We have done two curbless showers both of which were inspected. We used Schluter on both of them for everything including the bathroom floor. We used Kerdi band and waterproofed the Ditra to drywall joint several feet out from the shower on both jobs.

On the pan inspection we just filled it up to about where it would start to travel into the rest of the room. No issues with either. I think in general that our building departments around here at pretty reasonable.

By far the worst time I ever had was with one inspector and it was remedied by calling his boss.
He wouldn't pass something my HVAC guy did on a mini split drain, and after he told me he used duct tape and it passed back when he was an HVAC technician, I said have a nice day and called his boss... :laughing:We are looking to add a channel drain to an existing garage floor. The garage is 46’ wide and 40’ deep. We would like to cut the existing concrete about 6’ in from the garage doors and run the drain left to right across the garage. It will drain through the foundation on the right out to daylight.

The current garage slab has a slope from back to front of approx. 1/8” per foot. It is damn near perfectly level left to right. 

Access to the house is a quarter mile dirt road. The homeowner would like for snow/ice melt off the vehicles and/or the ability to hose the floor off into the drain.

Any suggestions for channel drain to use?I love what I do and I'm very good at it!

Da Vinci on the web or Da Vinci On FacebookAre you planning to patch the slab? Or to cut just enough?I really like the Aco Drain. You can get a variety of grates, it has an internal slope so you can set the top level and it will drain perfectly.

They also make a curved shovel that fits the profile of trench for cleaning it out, not a bad idea to have one.I have a project coming up that my client wants to replicate this look where the side wall and soffit, does not have to match cabinetry or it can has wood or veneer on it. 

I am talking to my cabinet guy as well about what options I have. 

One concern I have is if I use real wood I will lose about 3/4" spacing on the one wall, I could make it work but was considering veneer instead to save space. 

My concern with veneer is how do I use it around recessed med cab door(termination) and terminate it at vanity edge and soffit edges. 

Real wood would need to be joined( I am assuming cabinet company does not have 21" wide stuff) and come pre finished, maybe painter could match stain and finish(not liking this idea)?

I think I might be able to order fridge panel which is 24" wide x 8' would need to edge them maybe with stain ordered from cabinet company....

Any other options I am not seeing?Going with 3/4" from cabinet company. Any good ideas on how to cut side panel out for recess med cab door on site? Track saw is the best bet?

Going to sub this one out to trim guy. 

Door will be ordered so it will be finished on all sides and stain from cabinet company to finish edges where we cut for med cab opening.Make a drywall shim template, cut with track saw.

thanks!I want to give a quote on replacing a few windows. Only thing is how do I tell the difference between a replacement or nail gun window? Do I need to remove the siding to expose a fin if it’s there? I just don’t know if I need to quote for a replacement or a new construction window.What type of window are in there now? Vinyl - wood ? That will determine what direction you can go. The siding does not have to be removed to install a window with a nail fin. Can be cut back and a trim board installed. Removing the siding can be a can of worms depending on siding type. Vinyl siding just remove , can properly flash that way. Retro fit windows are ok if done right , personally I prefer complete replacements. If it has vinyls now check and see if it has been screwed in place through the side of the window and capped on the outside.
Kind of sounds like you need to find someone that has a little more window experience to look at that things and help you out a bit for a while.Right now there’s a vinyl double hung window in place. Home was built in 96’ which led me to believe it was a fun type window. I’ve put in a lot of replacement windows, just never had to replace any in a newer ish home. Thanks for the advice, if it is a new construction window I think I’ll just expose the siding and do it the right way.Jmsmith716 said:

HAHA yes. The wall that i intend to remove is in the middle of the truss system. Directly under the center king post and gusset plate where the bottom cord attach together. 

since it is a truss system roof. is it true that you can remove any walls from the interior with out fear of roof sag or worse collapse?all depends if it is a two point or three point bearing system.Okay, I'm so I guess my next step is to consult a structural engineer for that answer? Or is there a way to know for sure, without spending the money on an engineer?is there any place the trusses clear span or there isn't a wall under the center?It looks like the center wall is in a different place where your new kitchen island is going to be. So it probably only bears on the outside walls. But an engineer is the safe bet. Plus, the interior walls could be shear walls.

Looking below is another way to help determine if they are bearing walls.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.sorry for the late responses had to get the kids to bed.

The area where the kitchen island is could be spanned with a beam, engineer is definitely the safe bet, or removing all the insulation and carefully visually confirming if the bottom chord is attached to the center wall or is clear and attached with clips.What is the bottom chord of the truss?
What is the span of the truss?

Just looking thru a beer bottle, I don't see enough connecting truss elements to suggest those could span much of anything if the bottom chord is a 2x4.The bottom cord of the truss is 2x4. The span is just over 28 ft. I'll get some more pics of the bottom cord with the insulation peeled back.The bottom cord of the truss is 2x4. The span is just over 28 ft.

yep 2 foot centers....looks like i was mistaken... maybe i have Howe (K) trusses.Howe trusses with 20-24' clear span are dirt cheap. Last time I checked, clear span prices jumped around 28-30', so normally center supported would show up on longer spans.

That doesn't mean someone didn't install center supported, it just makes it less likely.You should be fine to move those walls wherever you want.

cement , i know is stronger,
but would be so much more labor intensive , and messier.and i`d have to make sure its perfectly level , and even, with the existing upper floor, so i can fill in with that engineered flooring .

wood seems to be faster easier , and neater ,
i don`t want it to sound hollow when we are done 
long time ago we had to do this when i was a helper , and they filled in the spaces with some product to keep it for sounding hollow when you walked on it 
or would double plywooding suffice, maybe putting rafters closer than every 16 inches too?

and suggestions?You could just build it like normal and then use structural spray foam under the joists.

Also, if it is built properly, it shouldn't squeak any more than a normal floor. I'd insulate it no matter what you do.

Run 2x6 joists (rafters?) 16" O.C. yes. These floors are so easy to make solid, by shimming every 3-4'. Use subfloor adhesive. Rip a 2x4 or piece of treated decking tapcon'd and glued down. Then regular shims, with glue and nail (screw) through joist. A row or two of solid bridging may help too. This with filling the bays with fiberglass batts will take you just about as close to concrete as can be done. They always sound and feel different, because it's not concrete.Jaja Wazak always said nothing good ever come from Canada2x6 with joist hangers. Support as mentioned above. No way I’d use concrete.

Tom.It is real hard to use a bull float indoors with walls, then end up with a nice transition, ask me how I know :sad:.Still "Shakin" the tree bossLedger board of 2x6 all around the peemiter, secured to studs with LedgerLok lags. 2x6 floor joists set into hangers. If the span is bigger than eight or ten feet, scrap pieces of treated 2x4 secured to the sides of the joists reaching down to touch the subfloor and provide mid-span support.

Done it dozens of times over the years. As long as the ceiling height can accommodate the higher floor, works perfectly. Slap a vapor barrier and insulation down before you hang the joists. Done.www.alchemyconstruction.cosunkist said:

Thinking of lighting options.

Option A: Only wall sconces. The room is a 24x24 L.

Option B: Drywall between the beams and install very low profile can type lights. I have some that only need about 1.5"

Option C: Install switched plugs at each bay up high on the wall and run some attractive old school lamp cord to fixtures hung between the beams.

Just spitballing ideas as they roll in. Anyone got something?

Space will be a hang out basement. Projector screen, card table, small bar, and a guest bed on the small leg of the L. There is a bathroom in the basement as well, which fills out the 24x24 square.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.Sounds like a shame to cover up the T&G if it's in good shape but if you do drywall there are slim LED pot lights that are only 1/2" deep. Probably still need strapping though I suppose. It might be the best looking and functioning option, it's a big room for only wall sconces.Track lighting or wire mount, maybe?

If you wanted to keep the 2x6 T&G exposed, could go somewhat of a retro/industrial look. Run metal conduit to lights. Could antique/ patina the conduit, or paint it black. Guess you could do a whitewash of the T&G boards if they seem to make the place to dark.

https://www.homedepot.com/p/True-Bl...mmock-Roll-FPR-1-Air-Filter-GS24201/202446750It seems like a lot of DIYers remodeling their old house get a lot of bad infirmation and bad advice. 

I'll repair a lot of plaster damage before I tear all the plaster and lath off the walls. Getting plumbing, heating, and electric redone may be a lot faster if you demo certain walls or certain rooms, but it's pretty rare that that's the fastest and cheapest way to go for the whole house.

There also seems to be some idea that vinyl siding us way better than wood, steel, or aluminum siding. Tear all that stuff off, and take it to the dump.

These people must value their spare time at $0 an hour, and their spare money at pennies on the dollar.

In their defense, it's obvious they don't have a clue and are getting no advice or incompetent advice. I met a nice young married couple who were redoing their first house. It was costing them more money and more time than they expected. If I had a couple spare days at the time, I would have volunteered to go through their house, give them some tips, and show them how to patch and skim plaster.

Bad advice is bad enough, but everything looks fast, cheap, and easy on YouTube.Lots of times too, these people are doing upgrades to the house that make the house to expensive for the type of house or area, There for never getting the money back out when they go to sell.Well if they're going to the big box stores you know they're very likely getting incorrect advice. But what I see more than anything is inferior work but the HO thinks it's great, they just don't know quality and what it takes to get it.I've seen the quality issues in spades, as has probably everyone. If they paid someone to do it, they'd be complaint, but everyone's baby is beautiful....I’m kinda in their boat right now, but at least I’m trying to keep as much original (besides plumbing and electrical) as possible. I’m luckier than most DIYers though, as I’m in the trades I’ve made a lot of valuable contacts. And when they need concrete done, I’m there for them.

Jeez, some of my favorite watering holes back then were called rathskellers.I'm not even talking about the DIY eclectic styles you can find, if you want to call them that...

I'm talking about deciding to insulate an old house, so the best idea is to pull all the siding and throw that away, then pull all the boards off the exterior and throw those away. Then install batts.... Not that batts have a prayer if fitting the old stud cavities.

I've gone over the house, there is no way I would expose the structure, it's just going to balloon into structural repairs. Not to mention there is no problem with the siding....Looking into getting an air scrubber or two. I know several of you have the BuildClean, and others the Ermator A600, DriEaz and box with a filter on it.

From what I've found, there's advantages to each...the BuildClean seems to have the 'biggest following' and I like that it draws air from 360 degrees around the unit. I like that it has an hour meter and an auto mode (though from reading it doesn't look like many use it?)

The DriEaz DefendAir and Phoenix GuardianR offer a carbon filter that seems like a nice addition in a remodeling setup come finish time, but no hour meter and what seems like a rather crude dimmer switch to control the speed. Also, no hour meter, so I guess you just follow the indicator light that comes on when it's time to do something with filters.

The Ermator A600 is the least expensive, but kinda looks like an old suitcase with a fan in it...I'm sure in person it's different, but it doesn't look like it's as tough as a rotomold device. 

I'll use it in general remodeling areas, kitchen/bathroom remodeling, small offices, etc. I'm all ears on anyone who's used any of these or multiples to hear how useability differs.

Thanks!www.stratmanconstruction.com

If Windycity doesn’t respond send him a PM , ask him how well it works.

TomI decided against the build clean because of it's 360 degree intake and it's almost twice the price. I wanted to be able to set the unit in a doorway or an opening in a plastic curtain wall so I went with the Blue Dri. 

I like that it has a standard 8" exhaust and 12" intake. It also uses regular 16x16x1" pre filters. Hour meter and the ability to stack and daisy chain is a plus too.tjbnwi said:

Now that sounds intriguing to me! I don't often dry cut mortar joints indoors, but that would indeed be a mess! More drywall and misc demo dust is what I'm concerned with, and I'll fully admit the 360 intake and 'auto' mode feels like a good idea if nothing else...www.stratmanconstruction.com

Like us on Facebook!I picked up the A600 (Husqvarna version) a month or so ago. It was purchased through Zoro.com with a nice discount. The unit is pretty heavy duty and built like pro-audio road gear. I like the cube design as it seems like it will be much easier to transport and store.

So far, the unit has performed great. I used it on an interior bathroom remodel (no windows) and it kept dust to a minimum.I use the jet air filter and use it on its side and put a handle on it. filters are cheap and are a 12x24. It has 3 timer settings and 3 speeds and can really move the air. Helps keep dust down during the remodeling process.

I wanted to mention a simple technique I often do in remodels. Negative pressure doesn't work if you need a door open to haul stuff in and out.

heheheh....yup.I see it. Seen it a fair amount. I'm not a mold expert, but I don't think it's mold. Although that would make sense. It's a black soot that develops on the joists, right in that area. Right where it is the coldest.

For the most part, I only see it when someone has a ventless gas heater. I have seen it with other types of heating, but never when its a gas furnace. Not saying it can't happen. I just haven't seen it.

People have asked me about it before. 99% of the time, they have a ventless gas heater.So, there is not a consensus that that is mold? 

There is no heater in the garage.

You might be right, because it's almost too orderly for mold.

Probably a short heal on the truss, the truss is just cold enough in that spot to condensate, dirt collects over time. Pretty common here.I can't compete with hacks.Studs on exterior walls are typically a bit cooler than the fiberglass insulation between them, thus the drywall reflects that. A quick google brings up this article; pay attention to the "Brownian motion" section. :thumbsup:

When you write your contract, just make sure to spell words out and not do it as if it is a text message. Even run a spell check. I've highlighted 3 examples above.

If you have a standard contract, have your lawyer look it through (yeah I know he'll charge you $150) but worth it in the end if something goes sideways.220...221...whatever it takes!Thnks fr ur great advice and usefl contribution . This really helps the cmmunity

Hi there - That's right .Were these construction law attorneys, or general counsel attorneys?In a 203k loan, the terms are dictated to you.

You submit your estimate, very itemized in regard to prices for labor , materials, subs, etc.

The appraiser determines if the completed project will appraise at the value needed to make the loan.

You get 50% to start.

When you complete the job and it is approved by the homeowner and the appraiser, you get the remainder.

Very little room for change orders.


They like you to break down prices for materials and labor in the event of an unforseen circumstance. So that you don’t charge an exorbitant amount for it when you are mid project.

I think I finally found one - who is not super big and who seems to have knowledge/experience in residential construction litigation . I sent them an email , I wish to post them here , but not sure if it violates any forum rules . However once I speak to them , I can vouch for their capabilities better .

In a 203k loan, the terms are dictated to you.

You submit your estimate, very itemized in regard to prices for labor , materials, subs, etc.

The appraiser determines if the completed project will appraise at the value needed to make the loan.

You get 50% to start.

When you complete the job and it is approved by the homeowner and the appraiser, you get the remainder.

Very little room for change orders.


They like you to break down prices for materials and labor in the event of an unforseen circumstance. So that you don’t charge an exorbitant amount for it when you are mid project.

Thank you so much sir - This is in line with what I spoke with others. I like to be very honest and stick to time lines , but just worried abt all the contractual stuff .I just purchased a house and used a 203K to finish it out, so I'm giving you the info from a customers perspective.
I could have done the work myself, but because I was borrowing, I couldn't be the acting GC. I had to have contracts with each contractor, which they submitted and were their typical contracts they would normally use. (Electrical, plumbing, insulation/sheetrock)
My purchase was a finished 1st floor; 2nd floor, studs, windows/french doors, some electric and sheetrock on ceiling.

The mortgage company I was using had all the forms necessary, for me, the customer, and of course they filled them all out, because there was a boatload.
There was an independant HUD rep who took care of inspection and initiating all draws.
As Mordekyle says, there was an initial draw, but in my case there was a total of (4) draws.
Each draw, the bank held back 10%, which is included in your final draw. So bear that in mind when determining how much you need to pay everyone along the way.

The mortgage company ended up wanting (1) of the (3) contractors to be the acting GC, and to include the (3) contracts into (1), on his own letterhead.

I wanted to do work on the project, which I was allowed, and there was even talk about reducing the mortgage amount depending on what I did and how much, but a reduction never happened, and I didn't push it because I got to have the quality I wanted with what I worked on. (Sheetrocker was terrible, so I did alot of taping, etc)

During the project, the mortgage company sold the loan to another company, but the HUD rep had already put in a draw request, so that took some time for the new company to get things in order and to send out a check. Didn't go over well with the contractors.

The mortgage co did have a contingency account, for change orders, which we did have to use once. The electrician realized toward the end that one leg that was already existing on the 2nd floor had never made it to the panel. So that took some time to correct, and the CO went through pretty easily.

Custom Cabinets in Hartford County ConnecticutI am considering taking on a steam shower build that would be my first, and am researching info and tips. The bathroom was demo'd and effectively job abandoned by another contractor with endless promises to return, but that's another story...:whistling Total footprint will be approx 9 x 12

This bath will likely have a contemporary look. In their archy "dream" renderings, One side of room calls for a 3x4 steam shower, plus a 6' soaking tub. No designer involved yet, so project cost not even ball-parked from what I can see. Does this sound like a steam shower build or a kit? Nobody is sure. Seems kind of small and costly for a build, but I haven't priced one out yet. Trying to assemble rough figures to see if this job is worth pursuing. 

Any thoughts appreciated.Was there supposed to be a dollar amount in your post somewhere?Xtrememtnbiker said:



Was there supposed to be a dollar amount in your post somewhere?

Click to expand...

Sorry about that. Initially there was a number, but I figured on getting flack and would then have to go into the total scope. It's less the number (I know the project budget/range) than the size of this steam shower on paper and that my sum of the parts on my "napkin number" comes out higher than the budget.

I guess I'm trying to confirm whether the kits would be a big dollar saver vs. a custom build. I think the answer is yes.I do alot of steam showers, the low end is about 12k and the high end is over 20k

This is what I normally do:

typical poured pan shower construction with liner, 12 inches up on the sides, kohler drain, 1/2 dura rock, mud and tape all the joints, redgard 

I like amerec steam units the best, make sure you have an additional drain plumbed for the unit, plus you need 220 elec w a seperate circuit

Install tile, we use ceg epoxy grout from custom building products

I silicone every penetration made in the shower walls 

things to consider
3x4 steam shower is kind of small
we recommend a bench of some sort, they make a lot of nice folding ones now
also if the customer is "older" I'd put a grab bar in
we always go with a custom shower door framless 3/8 glass runs around 2k
you will need a really high cfm fart fan, to suck the steam out of the bathroomSteam shower design & build

I'm sure this project is completed, but I wanted to post a reply. Steam showers and saunas are our specialty, and we've done thousands of them. This sounds like a fairly typical steam shower installation, which, while not a kit, can be a fairly simple process. 

There are important details that differentiate a steam shower from an ordinary shower, and I would be happy to offer advice if you ever need it.Accurate Industries

Thanks. 

I passed on it when 1) my plumber (former) went rogue and started dissing the drawings during the walk-through and b.s.ing the client on completely different products, and 2) the budget numbers were a bit unrealistic anyway. 

I have zero regrets.Kohler had a one piece shower enclosure steam shower kit years ago.

Customer absolutely insisted on having THAT shower.

Had to cut out the wall on the second floor to get it up and in.

Or route a spot for a metal square clip... those sheet metal brackets are garbage, I worked hotels for a long time those are cheap (not money wise I mean quality). A set of those will cost $20 and look awful, and you might have to find a window blind place to get a catalog and find one.

This at least gets you down a productive path. If you can identify the manufacturer, I say get the whole replacement. I've had subtle design changes screw me up before, so the current version of hardware isn't exactly the same, so you spend way more time and more money.I would suggest trying http://www.strybuc.com.

They are local to me (suburban Philadelphia), but sell nationwide. They have a huge inventory of hardware, hard to find hardware, etc. especially for doors and windows.

Sent from my SM-G530T using TapatalkOk, this is something I’ve never dealt with before, so I need some direction. 

We’re looking at a project (basement refinish). Complete gut and redo. The home originally had a two-car garage – under the first floor of the house (basement level). The previous homeowner had the garage portion finished along with the basement portion of the basement level – a real “wall of shame” type hack/homeowner project – no permits.

The two garage door openings were simply framed in, insulated, drywalled (interior) and sided (exterior). Currently, when it rains or snows, water comes in under the wall and saturates the baseboard and carpeting.

Do I need to put grade beams in where the doors were? Is there another way to handle this?I love what I do and I'm very good at it!

No pics yet, but even if I had them, it looks like a finished exterior/interior. The driveway slopes away – very, very little. Not enough.I love what I do and I'm very good at it!

Da Vinci on the web or Da Vinci On FacebookMay be able to skip the drain - but I'd definitely pour a small footing/stem wall in the openings AND flash it with coil that goes above the height of the stem walls and probably Grace in front of that 

If I can find some pics I did one like 6 years ago that we kerfed the concrete and had the roofer bend the flashing to slip in the cut while he was installing standing seam for us there.

Worked well

The existing house sits on caissons. Due to our soils, we don’t have too many structures built on footings. I think I would need to saw cut the slab, excavate, place a void then pour a grade beam between the caissons (epoxy pinned to the existing caissons/grade beams). I’d need to get the sill plate 8” above the grade.I love what I do and I'm very good at it!

In thinking about it, we are probably talking about the same thing - just different terms.

In reality, I was hoping you guys had some type of miracle solution - not requiring digging. I hate digging - even when I don't have to do it :laughing:I love what I do and I'm very good at it!

Da Vinci on the web or Da Vinci On Facebookno miracle solution i know of....

cut, dig & cuss.....:laughing:Well, in my opinion, digging is not necessary. 
Just pour a stem wall the same height that the existing stem walls are at, in the door opening. slope the earth away from the new stem wall of course. This will take care of most of the water that may try to migrate under the new stem wall pour.
Make sure the new stem wall in at least 6" high. 
Your biggest problem, of course, will be making sure the new concrete is sealed well enough against the old.
I don't see the need for a new footing under the framed opening.

will argue the keyway/sealant method to the death.....

it fails in freeze/thaw country if you do not provide a footing/stem wall system that eliminates the sealed/keyway/cold joint system.


water & ice are an incredible adversary....


may work in some parts of the country, but is not a bullet proof remedy.So, I talked to my engineer about this today and he gave me a couple of options for handling the garage door opening (basically what we discussed above). But then he blew my mind when I described what I wanted to do about the slope in the concrete garage floor.

Let me set a quick stage here:

•	The garage floor portion of the basement slopes by approx. 4-1/2” over 27’.

•	The bottom riser on the stairs from the upper floor is 10-1/2” (all the other risers are 7-1/2”).

•	The stairs land on the highest part of the concrete – back of the garage. So, I have 3” that I can raise the floor in the back and 7-1/2” in the front (nearest the garage doors).

•	My plan was to install sleepers 6-1/2” in depth that tapered down to 2” to level the floor. This entire sleeper floor would then be shimmed (with plastic shims approx. ¼”) to the appropriate height (add ¾” subfloor to leave me with my first 7-1/2” riser). All of this over a 6-mil poly vapor barrier sheet. Note: this sleeper floor structure is not attached to anything – not attached to the slab, the foundation… nothing. It literally floats on and with the slab.

•	I would leave the mechanicals (furnace, water heater and water purification system) sitting on the concrete in the unfinished utility closet (approx. 4’ x 10’). 

•	We would then use rigid foam between the sleepers to create an insulation barrier.

•	All of the walls would need a 3” slip joint at the bottom plates (that is standard procedure here) to allow the slab/floor to rise/fall without affecting the structure above.

After I described this to him, he said “No”! I was dumbfounded. He reasoned that that was a hack job and he would not stamp it. I pushed him on his reasoning and he just said take it to the county, but there’s no way they will approve a sleepered floor either.

Am I missing something here? This seemed like the simple part of the project.I love what I do and I'm very good at it!

Da Vinci on the web or Da Vinci On FacebookDid he have any suggestions?Just put down the poly-vinyl and then pour the floor.

Make life easy for yourself, it would be cheaper also.

That's a good idea but I wonder if at the 2" side it might not be thick enough as with the poly vapor barrier there won't be any connection between the new and old concrete, might feel a little loose?ScipioAfricanus said:

It will feel fine at 2".I need to attach 2x on the flat to hollow block. Tapcons, treated, adhesive....... easy but what if you dont want to use treated?

Tar paper behind regular fir and tapcons? Going to put extruded foam in between the stud and no I dont have the space to strap over foam.The idea behind using PT against masonry is that it's more moisture-tolerant than untreated. While felt would give you some protection, it's not really waterproof--just has variable permeability.

Plastic would probably be better, but still wouldn't stop moisture around the fasteners, whether tapcons, cut nails or whatever.

I'm curious as to why you don't want to use PT.Its above grade. The corrosion factor with electric boxes and construction fastenersDamned if you do, damned if you don't. I've seen plenty of furring like that decades old, with no protection at all and still in good shape. Above grade, I wouldn't have a problem with it.

But if it's getting inspected, my guess would be that the PT requirement will trump any concerns about the fasteners that are going to be used on it.Actually had spruce furring with 3/8 and paneling.Joist tape would eleviate some or most of the concerns about moisture at the anchor locations. Is the block wall new? I cant imagine moisture being an issue either way.Plastic electrical boxes and stainless drywall screws would be an easy fix if you do go PTi am providing some free technical advice to a neighbor redoing his garage/basement.

If it's 25 years old it's probably the type that used arsenic (CCA) and not the copper treated stuff that's so potentially corrosive.

Regarding the Op I think felt would be fine or the joist tape and probably as Tin stated nothing would probably work also. Galvanized Sheet metal will work also.So its not new but the rock had mold everywhere, none on the block but throughout on the rock. Lack of ventilation. They used two exhaust fans prior for air. Had an engineer come out for cutting out windows and enlarging a door but even then those windows wont be open often. We are killing wall AC and electric heat in favor of a ductless heat pump so mechanical conditioning.......


I have 5/4 spruce furring that we were going to pad out with 1/2 and then 2x4 flat on the new areas to blend in. My concern was the spruce looks great but the rock was moldy with a hollow wall cavity. I go sticking foaming in between and I no longer have that bit of drying.


If the walls were poured I would hilti the 2x but with hollow block the bounce I fear will jiggle them loose. the 2x is thicker than the cell wall or close.Foam first, then apply furring...done deal. I'd probably use foamular...it's slightly vapor permeable over foil faced."Under promise, over deliver and all that!" JBM

Because now the damned stop valves are closed up in the wall (closed position)...even though I bought a mixer with integral stops. I need to open up the wall to turn them on, so might as well make an access panel.

I have all my pipes insulated and the walls insulated to the bathrooms and while they aren't really noticeable when you are going about your routine, when you are in bed trying to sleep you can hear water running when somebody turns on a faucet.Trump-The "Con Man's" Con Man.I am doing a remodel of a bathroom in a home I just bought. The original bathroom had a normal bathtub in it that I took out and replaced with a walk in shower. I removed all the tongue and groove hardwood flooring that was where the shower base will be and put down a 3/4" piece of exterior grade plywood. I had to move the wall over into the adjacent room about a foot and a half to make it bigger. I wanted to know if I am alright building that wall on top of the hardwood flooring. It is oak flooring thats been in the house for 60 years, it is nailed to the subfloor quite well. I know about expansion and contraction of wood but I figured the subfloor has the same potential for movement as the hardwood flooring. This wall will be the wall that separates the bathroom from the bedroom. On the bathroom side, it will be covered in backerboard, kerdi and tiled.

Do I need to remove the flooring where I wanted to build the wall or is it ok to build the wall on top of the hardwood flooring? Thanks for the help!Why even think about building on top of it? Seems like a lazy way around it. Cut it out shouldn't be more than 2 staples/cleats within a foot of flooring.

Oh wait you're a painter never mind.I am just asking about the probabilty of the wood floor causing the wall to move because it will be tiled and I want it to remain water tight with the kerdiYou're more likely to see problems with the floor as the wall will bind it in place which can lead to buckling. You should also be securing the wall to the joists, not just the oak flooring or the subfloor. Tear it out.Jaws;1780140 said:

A square footage price in one state does not necessarily translate well in another state or even from city to city or even inside a single city or county.

This weekend before last I was at the deer lease to hunt dove with 8 other guys, 5 of us builders. 

A lot of sq ft numbers getting thrown around. But it was all experienced contractors in the same locale. 

" hey man what did that custom off of Fault Line come in at?" 

" what are you guys getting w/ lot and soft costs on that spec on Broken Arrow?" 

Both of those any of us answer with what it came it a ft

" what's Boyd running a sq ft these days?" 

I highly doubt any of us bid with a sq ft number. But when you estimate a bunch of stuff every year you kind of know what it runs are square foot on h v a c or under roof. For the type of house anyway.

Some of my subs do bid by sq ft. Like stucco, mason (per type of masonry) but only within reason. If I call my Mason to build one column it's not going to be anywhere near the same price

I never use square foot numbers with clients. Beyond their expertise.Everybody wants to be a beast until it's time to do what beasts do - Eric ThomasI need to select and buy a hood liner/powerpack/ insert pronto. Having never ordered this type before, what are the pertinent specs and what are they called exactly?

Range is 30", but as you can see, the opening underneath is a bit less (opening underneath is approx. 26 3/4 wide x 16 1/2" depth). Rest of appliances are Samsung, so whatever works will be fine. 

From what you see, do we want something to hang lower than the cabinetry a bit... or tucked completely up in there?

It will be vented through the wall, but that opening hasn't been made yet.

Thanks for any advice.I usually get the liner from who ever made the hood ( or their recommendation ) or find out what information the cabinet maker was going by to construct it. Just about everyone I have installed fit perfectly. And they all looked pretty much the same.Smallest liner I know of is 28”. 

Contact Vent-A-Hood. See if they can size one for you.

https://www.ventahood.com/index.php/about

Word to the wise, never build a hood cover without knowing which liner is going in it.

Does that front cover on the hood remove/open to install/service the fan, duct and liner?

Other option is trim the hood lower pieces to accept a 28.

You may need to go with a remote blower.

The paperwork/design/appliance cut sheets for the casework we do for these custom homes is around 400 pages. Appliance cut sheets will make up 175-225 of those pages. Design is made in harmony with the cut sheets. 

I think it is asinine to design a hood without access to the mechanicals.

Not sure yet, but sure sounds like a fun project. Ugh.All of the projects I've ever done with hoods the first thing you do is pick out the insert and build the hood to fit the insert.

Glad you found one that fit, because it seems awfully small for an insert.

Better check codes, having the wood overhang the stove like that wouldn't pass in my area. Especially if it's a gas top. The inspectors will usually go with the recommendations of the stove manufacturer for hood placement.The Tree of Liberty needs watering

Here we have to have all installation instructions showing clearances at time of final inspection. 

That 18"up and 6" over kills a lot of people who don't read the instructions especially when they use corbels alongside the range to hold up the hood.I did one where the cabinets were 17 15/16" and I worried because the inspectors can be very critical.The Tree of Liberty needs watering

Yes, they have ordered before, but the method baffles me. They supposedly run about 18 jobs concurrently, in various stages of completion.

Custom Cabinets in Hartford County ConnecticutHowdy all, I'm sure most have seen more last thread about the house I flipped. Now I'm onto the next project. 

This time it is a century home, I have not purchased yet as I am looking for a second opinion. I have gone through twice now and done an inspection myself. 

Positives:
-Newer plywood on roof.
-Majority of plumbing has been upgraded, main stack will need to be redone.
-Electrical has been redone with copper.
-Blow in insulation in ceiling, no vermiculite. 
-Newer Hi-Ef Furnace and HWT.

Negatives:
-Either foundation is leaking or the cleanout at the stack is leaking? I think it's the stack.It's old cast.
-Floors aren't exactly the most level.
-PLASTER.
-Only one wall outlet per room. 

So my thinking is this, the market will die off in the coming months because of winter, so I will have time to sit on it over winter and pick away at it. I will be able to do most of the work myself.

My Plan:
-Open up as many walls as possible - there is way too many walls in this place. 
-Restore window casings and door trim
-Either redo the existing old hardwood or leave it as is
-Do a beautiful kitchen
-It is a single bath, so put in a second and go above and beyond in the bathrooms.
-Clean up imperfections in the plaster, sand and paint. 

I have never worked on one of these so would love some input. :thumbsup::thumbsup:

I don't have any of that, don't want it, don't need it, never advertised in 29 years.The problems are the same throughout the trades, business-wise. 

From a work perspective, having a good relationship with code officials is really important because there are more. You don't deal with plumbing codes during window replacement. You don't deal with electrical code installing laminate in a living room. And you don't generally start moving walls across the room during a widow job. 

Total remodel of kitchen or bath often do. And that means code officials need to be your friend. Even if you don't like them.

Also, we do a lot of ADA accessibility bathroom remodels. You'll have to decide if you're ready to open that can of worms. You'll learn more about floor joists than you ever thought you could. It helps to have a good head for three dimensional thinking. You should be able to visualize the end product and the steps to get there.

You need sound skills in framing, sheet rock, paint, other flooring, finish carpentry, rot problem solving, "make it fit" problem solving and unhappy homeowner skills (because they've been using a port-a-potty for a week and can't shower).

Maybe start by gutting your own bathroom with your buddy, replace everything, move a couple things around and see if you still want to start a company in that niche market.

I absolutely love it, but frankly, there are easier places to start.avenge said:

First year we did about 400k in gross sales. Last year was 10 times that 10 years later. Other than Parade of Homes or a Showcase never advertised. All WOM. I imagine I'm in the top percentile for pricing too. I told a lady (who still booked an appt) yesterday if she's shopping price it's not worth her time for me to come out.

 you have to look at what your doing on those bids ,
your not just there to give a cost .
your there to sell yourself .
yes, you are a salesman now 
( just don`t be like the car salesman who is full of chitt, be that charming mo-fo that appears to really know what hes talking about )

you need for one to be good at presentation , and also a good listener ,

not saying you do this , but you cant just :
walk in , take measurements , and give a cost .

explain what your going to do 
explain your steps
explain the subs jobs , let them know your subs a good guys , 
let them know first and foremost you`ll keep the premises clean ,
many times a bathroom is in the middle of the house , you have to go through the whole house daily with trash , and tools .
let then know you`ll keep everything neat and orderly.
if they are going to be gone all day , you have to let them know your going to keep the house safe .
let them know that you`ll stay on the job every day until it gets done , you won`t job-hop , and leave them waiting days on end .

your a walking commercial

basically , your saying " i got this , you wont have to worry about a single thing. everything is going to be o.k"( and mean it )

you can even make a " scope of work " 
showing day one and 2 will be demo ,
day 3 -re-frame , 
day 4 , plumber completes rough
day 5 electric completes rough 
day 4 , etc..

" we should be done in aprox 2 weeks "
let them know when they can have their house back
.
your a house guest ,
make sure your not the houseguest from hell.dmaurice said:



Hey everyone, I'm thinking of starting my own remodeling business but I'm worried about what problems I will face. I am currently working as a tiler but I hate working for my boss and want to partner up with my friend who is a plumber. We mostly plan on doing bathroom remodeling. What are the biggest problems you have in your business now? Is it marketing, is it finding staff and keeping them?

Click to expand...

For me it was finding an excellent tile setter and plumber. So you might just have a good combination there.

Marketing depends on what type of business you have. As has been argued here, it can be highly important the more specialized you are. If you're a GC who only needs a few projects a year, it's easier to get WOM. Projects take a long time, have a lot of involved parties, are talked about a lot. 

But when you're cranking out 50-100 floors a year, or a couple dozen bathrooms, you might need more help marketing as WOM can die off.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.avenge said:

There you have it; if you want to work until you're dead don't advertise.:jester:

As usual Golden view is the voice of reason. Different strategies work for different niches but ALL businesses market.

Some don't have a budget but they network. They provide great customer service etc. Whenever I have to spend a little extra on a project I just chalk it up to a marketing expense; protecting my good name.

But if you have no reputation and no customers or your dad didn't give you his book of clients its pretty ******* hard to light a fire without a match. Can you rub two sticks together until something happens? Sure. But it sure is easier to use a lighter. Marketing is the match.

Wasn't thinking of you. I just know I started with nothing. No clients, no skills, no tools. I, personally, had a very hard time making money until I started allocating money and effort to marketing. 

If I had been smarter I would have gotten more serious about the marketing sooner. It literally cost me hundreds of thousands in lost revenue over the first five years of operation. But it takes time to learn what you don't know and I wasn't fully committed to the self employed life. It was just to get by until I could find a job. Except I couldn't find a job that would support my family."A smart man learns from his mistakes; a wise man learns from the mistakes of others."

Electrical ContractorHas anyone got the Nilfisk Attix 33? As I'm starting to work better at dust control and cleanup, I tend to think this is the vacuum I like, but I'd love to hear some other thoughts.

I know Milwaukee has a nice HEPA vac that Nilfisk makes, I'll have to take a better look at it as well I suppose...

Open to most anything, I like the auto filter clean and in general I'm a fan of smaller size vac's for portability...I have several Ridgid vac's and honestly the first one my guys reach for normally is the super small shop-vac that I once got for cleaning out trucks just because lugging a huge vacuum around a house is just cumbersome and overkill. Always makes me scratch my head that the vacuum gets more suction at a larger size...I still want to quickly suck things up on a window replacement job but I don't need a 10 gallon tank normally...www.stratmanconstruction.com
Like us on Facebook!We bought a Nilfisk when I was first certified for RRP work. Good vac, quiet, plenty of suction. 

That said I have since bought 3 Festool vacs and barely use the Nilfisk. The addition of tool start and variable speed make them more versatile over the Nilfisk for the same money IMHO. 

Also plenty out there with the Bosch, Milwaukee, and DeWalt Hepa vacs with good results.It is what it is...now fix it.:whistlingIt'd be the only Festool anything that I owned, so I'm not particularly partial to it, but I suppose I should take a look at them...www.stratmanconstruction.com

TomHello I am hanging my own shingle this year and have been making a handful of bids to customers for projects such as bathrooms, tilling floors, and decks. I have an estimate spreadsheet I use to come up with a price and email my prospective clients an estimate. I figure out how long it will take me to do the work, add up all the hours and then multiply by 1.25 for markup to cover profit. I have broken down my overheard to a weekly number of $475. So however long the project takes in weeks gets multiplied by that number. I then figure known materials and multiply that by 1.25 to get a markup. Taxes are built into that mark up. I am a one man show so all hours are mine. I want to ask is $50 an hour a reasonable rate to charge for labor? 

I think the people asking me for bids are surprised when the price comes back. When you tile a custom shower and pan it takes 3-5 days for one guy. Maybe more... Am I slow? Am I too high priced? 

I bid out three bathrooms for demo of existing tile and installation of new tile, new vanities, and new faucets. One bathroom has a tub that only the walls get re tiled. The other two bathrooms have full tiled showers which would have to be tore out and replaced. One is 3x5 and the other is 5x5. In total it was about 480 sq ft of tile installation. I used 7$ a sq ft for the tile allowance. Two new custom glass shower doors were included at an allowance of $4000 installed. With demo, two full showers and three floors I figured it would take me 5 weeks. the price I came up with was about $33500. One bathroom floor was about 100 sq ft the other two were 25 and 40. The customer said I was considerably out of her budget. 

I thought my spreadsheet I came up with worked fantastic and I think that the cost for remodeling three bathrooms that I came up with is reasonable. What do you think?I think you can get more help if you can attach your bid hereSounds pretty accurate to me.

Also sounds like you missed the most important part, qualifying the client.

Next time talk beans before you bid it, many people who have never had renovation work done have no concept of the workload/costs involved and have a mental number that is completely unrealistic.The Following User Says Thank You to Inner10 For This Useful Post: Leo GThe first day meeting with HO's I throw out ballpark numbers (i.e average sized mid-grade bath remodel $15-20k). Then I ask them how they plan to finance it. I cut right to the chase. 

If they are at all serious, I'll schedule a sit-down pow-wow to discuss further details. And I charge a consultation fee per hour.

The more bids/estimates that you do, the quicker and better you'll get ( plus you can pick out the A-holes in an instant)

Bid often and bid high. And never be desperate, HO's can smell it.The pleasure of winning a job that you bid too low is thin and very very temporary. It quickly turns into a nightmare of you trying to cut corners or rush the job to make it profitable. I know this because I did it for seven or eight years before I finally had the confidence in my skills to bid like a big boy. 

We aim for $55-$60 a man hour at the end of a job, for your reference; but that is derived from our expenses, our local market, and what I need as profit in order to want to beat my body up all day. If fifty is what you feel good about earning, then you are within the market range for where we live anyway.

It's hard at the beginning to remember this, but try to remind yourself all the time that not getting the job doesn't mean there was something wrong with your bid; it's entirely possible that this customer had a very unrealistic expectation of what remodeling costs. There may never have been a snowball's chance in hell you were going to get the job, unless you bid it so low you'd end up kicking yourself.

Now you can either offer to negotiate changes in the bid to make it more affordable for her (maybe the showers get a nice acrylic pan and tile walls, instead of full tile pan, for example?), or move on to putting your energy into hustling up the next job. Either way, take the advice from the gentlemen above and qualify the client to make sure you aren't wasting your time.

Click to expand...I love bathroom remodels. Hardly no cabinets and mostly labor. I did bathroom remodeling in Chicago and your numbers sound fair. Just remodel the master bath and let them save for the next bathroom. 

Justin - https://www.lafoundationrepairs.comI do estimates for free. They are ballpark only and I spend less than 30 minutes on them. Some, like bathrooms, I can do in less than 5 minutes. 

Bids, I charge for. 

By giving a quick estimate, I can see how serious the customer is. 

I recently learned this lesson, again. 
A friend wanted a room addition. Met with him and found out what he wanted. I did a bid, without thinking, he is a friend, with plenty of money. 
My price, $90,000. Fair price for what he wanted. 
Turns out, his budget was $34,000. 
If I had thrown out a quick estimate, or simply asked the budget, it would have saved time for both of us. 

Are you trying to charge the customer $50 per hour or are you trying to make $50 per hour. Makes a big difference.

I want to fold the sheets up for more convenient storageWhat have you not liked? We use Ram Board on most of our projects.I can't say I know from first-hand experience but my buddy uses it and he was complaining about it. It looked pretty beat up on his jobs it did not look like something that you going to get a lot of reuse out of.
So my attitude is a little bit of a knee-jerk one.I would agree. You're not going to use it on a 4 week long project and then roll it up and use it again. We save the pieces that are in good shape. Amazon sells the 38" x 100' rolls for $54 and it shows up at your door step, kinda nice.

When we are doing a kitchen or bath renovation for example, we use this to make a walkway from our point of entry into the house all the way to the work area. Sometimes those pieces are reusable unlike the ones that are more in the work zone.Do you have to fight the curl?Ramboard is an expendable. It's relatively cheap, customer pays anyway. I save a few pieces as throwdowns, but don't want to try and store a house or room worth.

Get Ramboard, don't even try to use the Trimaco stuff. That crap just keeps rolling back up. Tape won't hold it down and it refills up faster than you can roll it out. Not sure if they ever even tested it before putting it on the market. It took 2 hours to cover one small room after fighting it. Ramboard takes about 10 minutes for the same room. 

Sent from my SM-N950U using TapatalkWe use a lot of ramboard on the roll and I never really feel like we have a problem with curl. If you did, you could use the pre-creases (around 4" in) to stiffen it. We've completely stopped taping anything to finished floors, as we had an expensive ****up recently. Once a job is done, the ramboard is tossed.

If we need more floor protection, thermo-ply red is good. (That's their mid-thickness... and truthfully, I'm not sure why we don't use the slightly lighter green... maybe our yard doesn't stock it...) Depending on condition, we might carry a few sheets of this from job to job.

(a) you should open the door first, and 

(b) 1/2" OSB is good insurance for scary tile breakageAs stated before use ram board, off brands just don't work the same, I use 1/2 CDX if I'm trying to protect carpet, or tile floors, I can use CDX plywood later and it's stores nice

I may keep some pieces of ram board but usually the longer pieces, and if there not as dirty, most of the other get thrown out...It's probably worth keeping around to try. Heavier plywood is the ultimate security but I'm still keeping the Masonite around it will lay flatI recently used ramboard for the first time for the entire main floor of a house. A remodel job that took 3 weeks.

I taped the edges down with blue paint tape on mostly hardwood floor. In several spots I had it curling up. It was pretty annoying. Granted I didn't roll it backwards to decrease the curl first. Apparently a good way is to stick your paint tape on the floor first around the perimeter, and then tape the board down to this with a stronger tape. 

I just threw it out after the job. I didn't see the point in trying to salvage any of it.

All in all it stood up fine to the beating I put it through, but I wasn't completely impressed.

TomIf you tape to hardwood floor, it has a good potential of pulling the finish off. Ask me how I know...

In a bathroom we like to tile the floor and grout it then cover with Ramboard taped down about 6" in from the perimeter. This allows us to set cabinets and trim and such. Then when we get to the painting phase we paper mask from the trim out to the Ramboard and tape it down and you're good to go.

Are you able to leave the yellow tape down for several weeks without issue? Do you just pull it up or do you ever have to do the heat gun trick?So we had a customer who didn't like they way his shower turned out. He bought the materials and his wife didn't like the way it looked. He wanted us to rip it out for free and redo it. Obviously that isn't a solution most contractor or anyone would oblige to. So after refusing to pay the final payment of about $3000, he started to claim workmanship issues. I just chalked it up to a customer who wasn't happy with their choice of tile and moved on. Now he wants to sue us for what it would cost another contractor to replace the tile. So not only did he not pay us, stopped payment on a check to one of our contractors, but he also wants US to pay for his shower to be redone. 
My stance on this is unless that shower is being redone with the same tile selection (he had obvious buyers remorse) then he just trying to get a free, plus an extra $3200, shower. 
But here is my original question. He is taking me personally to small claims court. I filed an LLC a few weeks ago. In 4 years, he is only our second customer to be upset and it spurred me to go ahead and get an LLC just in case. Some people simply can't be please. They exist and you have to protect yourself and your personal property against people who simply refuse to be practical. So now that I have this LLC in place, can he actually sue me as a person or would it have had to be there to begin with at the start of the project? I personally don't believe we owe him anything. He actually owes us almost $4000 for non payment. I don't know what kind recourse or defense I have, but this all just sounds really shady on his part. My last contact with him was sending the final invoice and then him responding with "I am not paying you!" followed by insults and threats. 
Any insight would be helpful, we have never dealt with this before as we try to make sure all of our customers are happy. The only other person we couldn't please was a man that fired 8 realtors, had a history of contacting companies for refunds and credits (he got a free vanity from home depot because the box had a hole at delivery even though the vanity itself was flawless. He was relentless on the phone with companies. Getting free paint from Sherwin Williams because he claimed it was made wrong; wasn't. Free faucet because it was missing a piece it wasn't supposed to be sold with to begin with. He had a skill for free and just not getting off the phone until he got his way.) and believed it was his way or the highway. I let that one pass as a mentally troubled individual and moved on without our final payment. 
I am not saying that work is always perfect. There just isnt a way to have perfection every time, but some people simply aren't practical. I feel this case is buyers remorse, they bought tile they didn't like after it was installed. (sorry this may have also become a vent. I am just really upset). We pride ourselves in our work. We are A+ rated and 5 stars on yelp and google. There is a reason people hire us and rehire us. We have customers that we have literally worked on their first home buy, their second, and their third. We don't leave people not happy. 
ThanksYou have a contract?

We do not have a lien clause, just payment and materials terms. It is my fault for assuming most people in this world are good (that is my failure). I do communicate with our customers in emails and text to have things in writing. I should/will be setting up a more detailed contract.

www.gebcon.comtexas, maybe jaws can helpI got the paperwork dropped off today. He basically said his shower tile was installed looking like it was done with hatchets and that the entire project needs to be redone. The way it was worded was very unprofessional. To me it sounds like someone with entitlement issue, too far up on his horse. But regardless, we have court. After so many projects, so many 5 star reviews, and happy customers, I doubt we all of a sudden forgot how to install tile. 
While I agree his tile choice was not great, that isn't our fault. I am interested to see what he presents in court. 
Guess I'll be calling lawyers to see what our options are. 
Either way, we will go on with our lives with a successful company and this guy can just keep living his obvious miserable existence. If he treats us this way, I feel bad for anyone who has to deal with him every day.

Too bad there isn't Tyvek or house wrap on the outer side of your studs.

Andyhttps://andytardif.wixsite.com/websiteI frequently find myself needing to mud (the equivalent of) a room or two of new drywall—just big enough where it seems like it would be a pain to mix quickset for everything, yet small enough where if you use pre-mixed mud, your butt seams and outside corners won't be dry by the time you need to float your tapered seams... and a lot of the time I travel near an hour to reach my jobsites. 
Does anyone have recommendations besides (or including): 
-using quickset all the way (any efficient way to do that where you can still use a hawk, and not have to spend half your time keeping your mixing pan clean and booger-free?)
-using bucket mud and simply making as many trips as necessary to let seams dry before doing an intersecting one.
-using quickset first just on a roughly 2'x2' area anywhere there are seam intersections, then running bucket mud after that…
-using all bucket mud, with some trowel techniques to minimize deep ruts when you meet wet mud, accepting that you'll probably have to do extra rough sanding before the finish coat.

The question also applies to inside corners: does anyone ever try to quickset the first side, then regular mud on the second? Does anyone have any luck getting a sharp finish with an inside corner tool? (I don't…) Or does one always assume that you'll need at least two days to take care of inside corners?

PS I only have hand tools.

Thanks! My first post here…If you want to use quick set, mix a smaller amount multiple times so it doesn't set up on you before you can finish, that's what I do. It doesn't take that long to mix, just bring an extra bucket or two.

I generally mix 90 in a 2 gallon bucket, about 2 trays worth. It doesn't take long to clean the buckets after each batch is used, maybe a minute or two.

I've never tried mixing a half-bag of 90 at a time, so I will do that next time. Thanks again!If you hsve to do extra coursr sanding using bucket mud, hawk, trowel, and plastering technique, you need to work on your technique. You should be able to get a no sand or light 220 sand surface. You still have to have the tape bedded first, and thick coats of AP take longer to dry.

There are a few things you can do if you want AP to dry faster. Run a fan and keep fresh air coming in (or use a dehumidifier in high humidity); add an accelerator that makes the AP set up; add dry setting compound or plaster to your AP, turning it into a faster dry / setting mix.

I'll coat both sides of a corner with AP or setting type, but it takes a pretty steady hand to do it. I've messed up my share of them.....Time wasters are bad board, bad hang job, putting too little on for bedding, putting too much on for any coat. Ideal is a single wipe to get the right thickness and smooth it.Always bring extra buckets, sometimes the smartest thing to do is set the bucket aside and just let it set up.I've never done it, but some of the commercial guys will mix a whole bag of Durabond 240 and just work off that.

Except all the others.:laughing:I'll be finishing a basement next month and the current basement floor is a concrete slab with a drain in the laundry area along with some sloping down to it with an approximate diameter of 6'. This will be a permitted job, so I am wondering if it is ok to level the flooring as needed or do we have to retain the existing drain diameter?

To give more of a perspective of the finished product, the customer wants us to frame in the laundry room and tile the floors. Outside of the newly framed laundry room the customer would like LVT. This particular LVT requires a specific degree of slope of no more than 3/16" over 10', so I definitely will need to level the concrete subflooring outside of the laundry room. 

Mods, not sure if this is the right sub-forum, so feel free to move if there is a better one.

Thanks in advance.Any insight would be much appreciated.We don't eliminate floor drains or the slope to them here. We work in an area with a wet climate and appliances leak, break, or otherwise spew water where it doesn't belong.

Make friends with your local building officials. They're the best source of info about what can and can't be done according to code in your state, county or city. Most of the inspectors I've met like to answer questions before we do it wrong instead of after they tell us it didn't pass.

The IR receiver sticks down on those, but if you don't need it (using a 3rd party control system) you can likely shear it off. That TV also mounts with about 4 turns on 4 M6 bolts and the internals are not built to hold the weight of a frame and glass so you will have to hang the frame over the TV and secure it separately, which will be a nightmare to get tight to the screen.

You need to make sure that the load from both ends of the beam are carried to the foundation. If your roof if hand framed and that it a bearing wall then there is a pretty good chance that the basement beam is directly under the wall. Squash blocks between the sheathing and the beam are needed. If the post above lands within a foot of the basement post then you should be good (Rule of thumb is within the height of the joist). If not then you are putting a point load onto the beam below and that needs to be taken into consideration as well.Home Designer Series SoftwareI just looked at your pictures again.

He could always get real crazy and do a PSL postLet's look at this from a designer's perspective.

The house is located in Missouri where the codes are mandated by the county of residence if indeed there are any code requirements in said county. So figure that our first even if you do not intend or may not need to get permits.

In your area, you are probably under the 2012 or 2009 IRC.

Now, looking at your wall you have open I don't see any shear value that needs to be considered so the only load you have are gravity loads, Live, Dead and Snow loads perhaps. Find out what if any are the snow loads for your area.

After that, then it is a pretty simple thing to design a proper beam (I am thinking that 4x12 Larch #2 is fine) with solid bearing down to the existing footing on one side and a new footing on the other, designed for your frost depth if any.

Pretty simple calcs really.

Click to expand...Is 16 feet too long of a run to vent through a gable? I can duct up through the roof, but i am concerned about snow laying on the roof and blocking the roof cap. Its a 4/12 roof.Depends on the size of your fan & duct.

Might have to go with an inline.The bathroom is small and only needs 50 cfm. I upsized the fan to 80 cfm to hopefully overcome the long run. If I go horizontal out the gable I plan to use rigid 4 inch pipe, and insulate it. It would be much easier to go up thtough the roof, would only be a 4 foot vertical pipe, but my main concern is snow buildup.I built in snow country for a number of years.

Murphy crickets solved many problems like what you have.Go through the roof. I have been doing it for thirty years. Use a broan roof hood that is made for a bathroom fan. They usually sell them at the big box stores right next to the fans. The way they are designed the snow has no effect on them. Wrap some insulation around the vet pipe to stop the pipe from condensation. I always use four inch rigid pipe and foil tape all the joints.

good luck..........nicko"Quality work for those who know the difference"Just had the same decision. Gable 2x the run. Through the roof with 2 exhaust into 6"x10" Broan type black roof vent from these folks.

Of all the options, soffit's are the one of the worse places to vent. The only thing worse would be running the duct into the eave. You run the risk of pulling the moisture back into the attic (assuming there are eave vents). I believe Panasonic just introduced a new soffit vent termination to help better address soffit venting.Through the roof is almost always my choice...and rigid pipe.

https://www.lafoundationrepairs.comI ended up ducting through the gable with 4 inch PVC sewer and drain pipe(the smooth green stuff). Insulated with 5 inch insulated flex duct slipped over the PVC. The fan works fantastic, no noticeable loss in output from the 16 foot run. I did oversize the fan to help to overcome the long duct run. FYI, I used a Delta Breeze fan special ordered from Home Depot. Great fan, LED light and super quiet.

What’s wrong with through the soffit? That’s how my lazy ass HVAC guy always does it.It was originally ducted through the vented soffit, and was not a good situation. The builder simply used flex duct and turned it facing downward to vent out through the little perforations in the vented vinyl soffit. After 20 years of the old fan operating like that the underside of the roof sheathing in that area was covered in black mold. I looked at it in the winter and the sheathing was also covered with ice on the underside. Thats why I hesitated to vent through the soffit again after seeing that mess.dale rex said:

I looked at it in the winter and the sheathing was also covered with ice on the underside. Thats why I hesitated to vent through the soffit again after seeing that mess.

As Dale mentioned, that moisture-laden air tends to get sucked right back up into the attic space. You may just have a winning formula with your 4' of unvented soffit, but I'd class you as an albino rhinoceros for doing that.

Custom Cabinets in Hartford County ConnecticutI read the Vice-Versa post on this site "Replace Casement with Double Hung."
The house was built in '89, the sills, outside mill-work, etc are all rotten; I can buy a New Construction casement window for around $350± but these windows have few options & are made of Vinyl and are therefore, arguably not paint-able; to get the desired options & look I would need to spend up to $800/window & I have 20 windows to replace. So, I'm considering buying Replacement casement windows & replacing all the rotten mill-work myself, then inserting the replacement casement window.

Advice/thoughts/don't F-ing attempt this, etc?

ThanksSo you are talking about pulling the sashes , replace the rotting jams then install a retro fit window ? Wont do it if it was me. A number of companies any more that make window in different colors . Not sure you will save much in the long run. What makes the 800 one so much better of an window?What part of the country and how upscale is the house?

When I was in the mid-Atlantic area, capping a window and sliding in a replacement was normal practice. There were good metal guys or crappy ones. You can make it look good with experience. 

I wouldn’t replace all of those silks just to leave a new wood sill that will rot again. 



Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkRemoving everything to the studs & building to the Replacement Casement Window. The cheaper the window, the less options offered & they are much less ornate, very unappealing when you get down to the bottom price; but I just checked w/ Home Depot & their replacement & new construction Casement windows are about the same price; but I've learned to not put too much weight on what a Rep. tells you until it's verified in some manner.
To reply to both, I'm in the Eastern part of VA (mid-Atlantic); it's an Upper Middle Class home @ 2,800 SF, well built but not maintained at all & no gutters which contributed to the rotting issue, gutters now installed.So this is your home?

You list your trade as "Benchmark". What sort of hammer-swinging does that entail?Home Depot sells the Anderson line of windows
Difference between new construction and replacement window is the replacements are all vinyl and the others have wood
with vinyl covering the outside trim.

Now that being said, I have used the replacements and framed wood around them and it is not that hard to do.Framer53 said:

Andersen makes the Fibrex 100 series which are not a bad window. Lots of colors, and not vinyl. Personally I don't care for the vinyl wrapped ones. and don't use them .I am a trim carpenter by trade and understand working with wood very well. However my wife has started a boutique and wants me to redo an old store front to match a photo she found on pinterest. I am having a difficult time thinking outside of the box and coming up with what kind of materials I should use to replicate the attached photo. All i can think of is Marine Grade Ply but i dont think that will hold up the best outdoors over the years. Any suggestions on what kind of medium i should be working with and where i can obtain it for the top black part specifically?

Thanks,

Sent from my SM-N950U using TapatalkI am renovating a single story commercial building (Medical Office) that was built in 1963. The original interior finish is all plaster over lath. Has been a major PITA. We put new sheetrock over a lot of walls, put in custom jambs, etc. All that is looking good. 

There is a section of ceiling over the waiting room that is higher that the rest of the place, which had standard ceiling framing. This area has, instead of wood framing, steel girders that are about 2" high by 1/2" thick. They are hanging from the roof joists (flat roof) by wire, ala drop ceiling. There appears to be mesh attached to the bottom of the little steel girders, and then plaster applied from below. 

Issue is that plaster ceiling is in rough shape. There is no framing in the ceiling to attach drywall to if I was to want to put a fresh layer in. I think perhaps stamped tin panels might look nice, but, again, not sure how to attach. 

Compounding things, there is a rough popcorn style finish on the existing ceiling, so I can't really glue up a new ceiling.

Any ideas?????

Thanks! TomRip it all out. Attach new framing to existing "2 in. girders". Add drywall.

Scrape popcorn. Roll on some eucoweld or similar. Skim coat all with hot mud. Use fibafuse or similar if existing surace is trashed.

Greensboro, NCI get it from a local glass company along with letter for inspector.Not sure if this is the best spot for this thread. I was reading an older thread regarding this subject a while ago but can't find it again.

Looking at a job which will require insulating the ceiling of an enclosed carport. The carport is currently finished (diy) and will be stripped down to framing to address electrical and insulation issues. Above the carport is half living space, half covered deck. Ceiling currently has batt insulation. 330sq ft of ceiling and the carport will be heated inside. 

Curious what others have done in this situation. I'm leaning towards spray foam but if less expensive options exist that will control condensation I'm interested to hear. 


SeanVanity counter with backsplash (no sideplash) was set on top of a 1/4" plywood cabinet. This is a two wall cabinet and was wood shimmed in place. The counter only now rocks, forward to back. Caulk was used to set it.

To fix, what might hold it down in place?

Was thinking PL adhesive, maybe or maybe not to hold cut support blocks from the inside (but how to keep these blocks from sagging while drying on so thin a wall? Would rather not clamp onto the face -- a smooth matt painted finish)...

What's a better way?The cabinets should have been leveled with the tops on plane. The top should have been placed with 100% silicone, no shimming necessary.

 My thoughts exactly. Not shims placed per cabinet and per top. Now I'm stuck with it.

Wondering if the silicone would alone hold gapping? Seems there needs to be structure added...Am I reading this correctly? It's a vanity with 1/4" sides between two walls that was not properly set?... want to be clear what you meant by "two wall cabinet"...

If that's accurate, you have two real options...
1. Disconnect the plumbing, pop the top, Re-set the vanity so it's leveled properly, then silicone and drop the top back in place, and reconnect plumbing...

2. Since it's between two walls and you can't see the sides, your other option is placing a shim so it's as close to level as possible and so it doesn't rock anymore and then glue support blocks on the inside of the vanity on the sides and the top (with a hit of silicone on top of the block touching the counter...​Neither will take a tremendous amount of time... personally, I'd do it right (#1) and be sure to point it out to the customer to use it as a tool to generate word of mouth and adopt a client because "you do it right"... and become their "go-to guy because you do it right"....KAP said:

Like us on Facebook!I'd open the wall up on the left (you're going to do it anyway), and get up in the attic as well, to get a clear picture before deciding to demo anything else... it's a very odd design element in and of itself, so it might have been a way to hide or draw away from a structural need rather than block the open feel of the room by closing it off...

Custom Cabinets in Hartford County ConnecticutQuick question, currently doing the largest remodel I have ever done through my company. I bid as fixed price but showed detail SOV.

Do you guys account for(hidden or not in bid) contingencies in order to avoid change ordering to death from day one?

I am running into existing conditions left and right, one major issue and many many smaller ones. 

Obviously my proposal reflects work per plans and price may change upon opening walls. But getting a lot of flack from client, everything is 100% legitimate and he agrees typically.

I am just wondering if it’s worth accounting for a contingency and risk losing a job via being an even higher(-we’re charging enough already right?!!) bidder, in order to avoid the inevitable first few change orders on project.

Also sort of curious as to how widespread or not the practice is.There are always contingencies and unforeseeable items. The balance is what to charge in anticipation and what to change order. Over the past 10 years I have developed a percentage multiplier for the various aspects of a job. I assess the job by reviewing the home (most are easily deciphered without opening the walls) layout and through experience determine what the likelihood is that I will run into an unforeseen.

But then I also explain and put in writing that we will stop the project and assess any major unforeseen. It could be $500, $1000, $2000. It all depends on the scope and billing method.

For instance, say I am bidding a kitchen with soffits. The soffits may or may not contain plumbing, electrical or other a number of objects that need to be relocated. I will include something in my initial estimate to cover some of the issues that have come up in the past. When they agree to the estimate (range), I schedule a time to go out, poke a hole in the soffit and scope it out. Now I have a good idea, before we start on what we might be getting into. But since the process isn't perfect, there are always items that come up (even small ones). That is why I state, in the contract, that we will stop work and assess the situation and come up with an agreement before moving forward. This allows for all parties to feel comfortable with the resolution, but also incentives the client into making a decision before work will proceed.

My question to you would be what small issues have you run into and what are the large issues. What is the scope of this project?Tried & True on Facebook

Click to expand...what TNT said, 

I will add that even though it seems like a pita to continue to do change orders, I would rather have one too many, than one too few, but having a defined process like TNT spelled out so the customer knows what to expect when change orders are needed is key 

the only contingency pricing I would do is unit pricing where it works, ie replace roof sheathing as needed $***.xx per sheetThere are many ways to tackle it, but I think it's best to close the deal by using your experience and either building it in or stating outright what you could expect (without the numbers for the changes). It builds confidence and eliminates the surprise factor, should changes be required. 

Also, I think a certain amount of "pita surprises" should be in the number anyway, but do mention these when handled...it eases the pain for the others.Bull Trout said:

Small issues are architectural drawings wayy off regarding layout, wall types and details. We are having to relocate about 40-50 linear feet of walls to accommodate the floor plan client wants.

Bigger issue is the plans showed updated copper water supply and pvc sanitary. All existing, and new bath/kitchen to tie into existing locations. Unfortunately after demo we found galvanized(I think ) water lines run through slab, horrible shaped probably original, and original cast iron sanitary. 

Not sure how the archy determined plumbing was recently updated.

Now in electrical we are running into having to relocate existing service into home. Plans show exiting location, but as per the new layout, we have to move the meter. (I could’ve caught this if I had spent more time walking before, but plans showed existing). Lights and smoke detectors shown as existing, but were never there. Etc.

Just steady stream of issues, some could have been caught by me, and client is starting to ask with that tone. To me, all of these are billable as CO, as unfortunate as that sounds to them.LPG said:

Don't see how much of that would have been solved by contingencies... most likely even if it was there in some form, you would have ended up with CO's on that one to cover the difference... In fact, the archy (yours or theirs?) mistakes are an example of what CO's usually cover...

The way we handle it is very detailed SOW, drawings and contract and the Superman speech...

"Because we don't have X-Ray vision, every job has a potential of presenting unforeseen circumstances (this is where we point out that clause) that were not necessarily possible to determine until walls were opened, etc... The price we give you is the price you pay for everything listed in our agreement... anything that's needed above and beyond that is addressed with a Change Order, which you will approve before any changes are made..."​Contingencies are better used when delineating between levels of materials/products used... we nail that down as mush as possible ahead of time because we don't want to work twice for free...Had always interpreted the use of a contingency to cover gaps in work from either missed in estimate or unexpected, not really having to do with allowances or finishes. Personally have never used them, either ate them(if small or not worth mentioning) or billed as CO. 

Only reason I’m giving this much thought is that nearly every trade on site is coming back with a never ending series of conflicts. And I’m talking about above and beyond what we typically deal with on any remodel. 

Thank god the archy was clients. Not hard to shine after the experience they went through before I was even in picture.Hey all im residing my 1860s house and im trying to decide what i want to do i figured id get some other opinions.

Heres the deal the house has vinyl siding but has the old wooden clapboard siding underneath. Ive ripped about 1/3 of the vinyl off and discoverd that the wood siding under it is in good shape and im thinking about ditching the vynal all together. Now i have no issues with vinyl but i take issue with this installation, it being installed over the clapboard creates a wall void and in the section i took down i found multiple paper wasp nests, i also feel like the house is hiddin and wont be able to spot other potential problems under the vynal in the future.

So i guess im asking what would you guys do? Scrape and paint or put up new vinyl? Ive included a couple picsThat wood siding looks like a mess. 

In your situation, I’d probably fan fold and put new vinyl up.-Johnslowsol said:

YouTubeBad thing is that old of a house more then likely has lead paint on it , so then you have that to deal with. As a home owner you can get away with it, but do you want all that mess around your house in the dirt. All the time of sanding it and painting so you can do it again a few years down the road, not me would cover it with something .Lead paint chips make the plants grow better.Ouch ya its lead paint for sure but im not scared and ya the siding is full of nails and staples from the vinyl job but the wood seems solid no cracks or lifting or rot. 
I dunno seems like a waste to rip perfectly good siding off just cause i dont want to paint...is going back over it with vinyl acceptable? I wouldnt know how to keep the fing paper wasps out of the void is the thingIt depends if this is your long term house and your budget. If you arnt that tide to the house and don't have a large budget than vinyl is the go to. If you are staying for a long time and have a good budget it might be worth buying a little nicer material. Either way I would install new siding before restoring the old. Looks like a good house for a lift as well. I can install as more siding by myself with a lift than I can off planks with another guy. Not to mentions its less frustrating and a lot safer.It seems most people would go vinyl, im kinda surprised i thought at least some would hate it. Its kinda looked down on around here we even have some homeowners assc with ordinances against it. That being said keep the opinions coming i have no idea what i want to do yet.

And how would you guys do the install over the wood siding? Or strip off the clapboard and install vinyl against the sheathing?

P.s this is my long term house i bought it for the land knowing the house needed a bit of work but ive got waterfrontage and a dock so its worth it to me. My budget is about 10k maxFrankSmith said:

You have that right . I use mine anywhere I can get it in to work too.I dislike the look of vinyl so if it was my house I would doctor up the wood siding one side at a time and paint it. If it's original that's saying something for the wood. I'd invest in an airless if I didn't have one.Most likely the house built in that time used "Brick Nogging" and clapboard siding went right over it and nailed into studs and there is no insulation. I did a whole house renovation with a rear addition which was built about the same time in the 1890's it had the same thing, clapboard siding and aluminum siding over it only they used nailing strips 16"OC over clapboard. I used rigid foam insulation over the clapboard and the house looked awesome after it was completed not to mention had some insulation which helped a lot.I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​Metheds21 said:

Click to expand...

Box of matches and some ground round then.Depends on how much time you want to spend on it. 

I'd tend to rehab the wood siding. Chances are the tar paper under the clapboards is gone. If you get into that, you're pulling the clapboards, so just take the paint off the edge, and flip them over when you reinstall so you have all bare wood to paint.10K is plenty for equipment and materials. 4x 24' ladders, electric power washer, spray rig, filler, caulk, paint. Easily under 5K.If you can put 200 hours of your time into it, you can probably refurb it beautifully on a low budget. I never liked the look of vinyl at all. So this would be my vote.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.hdavis said:

What part of the country are you in? I personally hate vinyl siding for a lot of reasons. But it seems to be a very popular option in other parts of the country. Especially the wetter parts. Around here, it's not allowed on new construction, period. The sun and the wind destroy it pretty quickly. Not to mention the reflection off of windows melting their neighbor's siding. 

My main reason for hating it, is just like you said. There are a million places for the bugs build their nests. 

There are a lot of options for vinyl though, and if you go that route, at least go up the quality scale a notch or two, avoid the cheapest product. Also, look up what fanfold is. Someone mentioned it earlier, but it sounds like you're not familiar with it.Lettusbee said:

I'm guessing whole house size based on what I see. His labor is free in this equation. That gable end wouldn't take me 20 hours to clean, fill, caulk, final scrape, and paint 2 coats, and That's working off of ladders.

Oh, ok. I didn't read it correctly. I though you were referring to putting up new siding. 

ThanksFanfold is normally used on top of the old clapboard, serves a number of purposes. Air seals older houses and provides a flat surface for the new siding. While I know it is not for every part of the country, a good steel job is hard to beat. Can last a long time ,40 -50 yrs or more. In 20 yrs of residing house have only done 3 vinyl jobs. Would be hard pressed to use it.I live in the Phoenix area and have been increasingly coming across this problem. At some point, someone encloses a carport to turn it into a garage. However, there isn't the standard 6" between the ground and top of the foundation, so water will leak into their garage. Usually there is maybe 1/2" between the ground and top of foundation, sometimes it's actually below ground level and sometimes there are concrete walkways adjacent to them at the same level (that are not redirecting the water properly). They definitely don't want to spend the money to re-pour a foundation, and digging the ground lower usually isn't an option because it would be on their neighbor's property.

If posts or bottom plate really need replacing we will jack up the house and replace them. At that time we try to run a moisture barrier underneath the wood and wrap it up a few inches in the interior as well as the exterior. Then we silicone it at the foundation. We also hold the drywall up a few inches and use cement board siding as a baseboard. We also recommend gutters and French drains.

If replacing boards is not an option, we do the best we can to weatherproof with an adhesive flashing and top it with an elastomeric product or use silicone.

The nature of the structure requires our siding (typically cement boards) to come in contact with the ground (or adjacent sidewalk) which I know isn't recommended but anything else would expose the studs underneath.

Does anyone have any recommendations on how to improve this process?You can spend the money to do it correctly, or you can scab a temporary "solution" to the problem

If the customer cant afford 24' of proper foundation, they probably shouldn't be remodelingBull Trout said:

Yeah, unfortunately it's still way out of their budget. Even this is pushing their budget. If we don't scab it for them, they are just going to get someone else that will. And from the scabs I've seen tried on these homes, they aren't going to be doing a better job and will potentially be making things worse.See that situation around my parts fairly regular. HO's enclose carports or back patio slabs and wonder why waters coming in around the plates. 
Theres no solution that they will like hearing. 
I just priced one out for a young couple just beforw the holidays. They calles me out to replace some sill,stud , and sheathing rot. What i found was that not only was the back addition slab below grade, no footings and a false wall sitting on dirt to hide an old retaining wall (actually , now the bearing wall) from when it was a patio slab. My price was to temp support roof, demo walls as needed, cut the slab back and pour new footings, block or concrete up to 8" above grade and reframe walls. Trying to keep as much as we can as to keep cost down. Told him i cant do any type of half assed repair and leave with no footings 
Poor couple just bought this place a month earlier.

My question is can we run the beam that will carry the second floor joists and hip side of roof all the way to the corner and eliminate the sheathing to not have a small wall projecting into addition or does is still qualify as a structural component and need to maintain a minimum amount of sheathing from the Corner. The addition took off from that corner and extedd the house wall 30’.how wide is the opening going to be?Trump-The "Con Man's" Con Man.If you are asking us for permission then I say...go right ahead.

If you are asking if it is doable then I say...yes it is doable.

If you are asking how this new opening will affect the rest of the structure, I say...How do we know?

Andy.https://andytardif.wixsite.com/websiteTimNJ - The width of the wall is 26' with two stories. we would be leaving 4' on one side of the opening and running the beam 21' leaving approx 1' on the other end of wall framed/sheeted. the house is balloon framed and stacked sheeting as well.Thanks Andy for your reply. I know its a vag question and you don't have all the information to answer it thoroughly but just looking for generalized input from situations folks may have encountered.My point is that you are asking for structural advice on a project that you have not described well enough for anyone to understand. Actually, a description will not do at all. I or another designer would need plans in sufficient detail to show us the whole structure in order to be able to help.
It seems that you are asking about the new shear value of the house since you opened the wall for the addition. How could one analyze that without having greater detail of the house?

That and about $500.00.

I wouldn't be surprised an engineer designs the whole thing in steel for that big of an opening and all bearing.Trump-The "Con Man's" Con Man.Yeah, that's a large opening with 2nd story & roof load to be doing with an LVL. Way too little info to deal with, but with a double/triple LVL it'd likely be such a tall beam the customer wouldn't have much room to walk under it...unless you really perform surgery and recess it all...again, we have no pictures/drawings to even hypothetically tell you what's do-able...get an engineer!www.stratmanconstruction.com
Like us on Facebook!You need Two very large footing pads, centered under each end of the New Beam, Half of the new additions load,15 ft? x 45 lbs load/sq/ft? plus the old loads of two stories and a roof (and and a basement wall? addition SOG or bearing on old foundation....)

15 x (45 x 3 floors old and new) x 13' of beam =~26325 lbs on one end, a 3 Klbs per sq ft soil capacity, that is 3' square footer under the beam ends. no consideration of roof loads here yet...

2 x 8 stud framing would lessen some of the lack of shear wall issues, and or some post stress tension bracing inside the long straight wall.

You could add a 3 or 4' long shear wall panel to the outside of the building at the party wall line.I might be an Idiot, but I know things that You don't: Please wait till after you get my know-how to insult me....If the house is balloon framed you know the foundation would be inadequate to take that concentrated load.

I have only run into one foundation that was poured in an old house (pre 1940's). The rest have either been brick or stones stacked.Trump-The "Con Man's" Con Man.Are you working under an inspection requiring permit?

Normally any remodel over~25 % requires the entire structure brought up to code, most people would consider the installation of a 26' foot wide opening alone to be a major project.

A anal inspector might require ALL the balloon framing fire blocking inspected for actually existing, and being installed correctly...:sad:

Unless the home has already been underpinned, the legacy foundation is most likely in some state of failure if not rebar re-enforced spread footings were used of adequate size. Thus preventing any type of addition adding loads and or removing load paths, even redundant ones. 

Older quality balloon framing(later work might steel straps X-ed in.) would have diagonal "wind" braces cut into the studs at all corner, this would need to be repaired or replace if cut/removed.

You might want to spend a few moments learning how homes stand up for years, especially google the words "Portal braces":thumbsup:I might be an Idiot, but I know things that You don't: Please wait till after you get my know-how to insult me....Or, Moment Frame Design.Hello all,

This is my first post. I hope to use this forum as a resource from here on. I'm wondering if anyone has input on plastic, vinyl, and/or acrylic sheet goods for shower wall surrounds. I've had a few potential clients ask for a basic shower renovation and I can't seem to find a supplier for an imitation tile plastic sheet good. It seems a company like "Bath Fitters" has this material held hostage. I've seen their pans to wall seams fail. Currently, a customer has something like this done years ago. The original shower pan and the pan that was laid over it now have water in between them. I'm planing to pull everything out walls and pans. I'll put in a new pan but want to give an entry level option for wall covering. Any thoughts are much appreciated.

p.s. I'm thinking this should be available as a sheet good so I can cut to fit as needed. That means I'll need trim pieces too.

Thank you

It usually doesn't take too many years for something like that to fail. Wham, bam, take the money and run.

I think you'll find that most of the folks around here don't care for that as a business model.Ok. Look up Swan easy up. Subway tile look, glue it up.Care for what as a business model?Hard sell, slap up a cheap product and disappear.Is that what you think I do? You've only just read a few sentences that I posted. You don't know me or the way I do business. Don't be so judgmental. What's wrong with using a solid vinyl wall covering? This is done all of the time. There is no hard sell. I don't see anything wrong with the product. I find issues usually with the workmanship.Hey, you're the one who mentioned Bathfitters. :laughing:

Didn't mean to say you're a hack. It's just that paste-up vinyl tends to be toward the low end (though not always). I wouldn't put it in my house.I wouldn't make it my choice either but I also save my self a lot of money when I know how to do the tile work myself. Sometime people want fresh and I'm here to provide my clients with solutions. I don't say "bath fitters" with any sort of positive connotation. Everyone knows what product I'm talking about though when I mention that. It's all they do. I'm just looking to source the plastic sheet goods with an imitation tile look. As long as I install it in a quality manner it shouldn't give the customers any issues (unless you have some more great insight that I don't know about).I do expect it to be the low-end for cost. I don't see any issue with function though. The quality of the caulk at all of the seams is the important part.Randyj_302 said:

The only insight I have is that it's pretty difficult to do a really quality long-lasting install with that stuff. Not saying it can't be done, but I've torn out way too much of it to feel very optimistic.

Man, I apologize, okay? Sorry to get off on the wrong foot.

I don't consider myself hypocritical at all in that respect. I did a few early on, before I knew better. I've done a few since, when the client absolutely insisted on it despite my best efforts to guide him to a more durable (albeit more expensive) solution.

My point was simply that it's not a solution most of us would go for if we want a rep for quality work.I want to hang an 80x32 frameless mirror with a french cleat or similar so it can float away from the wall 3/4" and have no visible clips.

Can anyone recommend a glue that I can trust to glue a 1x4 to the back of this mirror to support all its weight, and that won't mess up the mirror finish?You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.I have done this 3 times without any issues. I used a urethane type caulking. I can't say for sure if it will eat the silver over time but it is definitely a solid bond. All times I did it I glued a 5/4 PVC frame and let it lay flat and cure over night before hanging.

The client wanted the mirror edge all lit up. I built the PVC frame about 1" back from the edge and used led tape lighting adhered around the frame.It is what it is...now fix it.:whistlingWe played with the lighting idea too and then decided to keep it simpler.

So if I was to build a house, could I build 499 sq ft at a time!! 🤔 😗 the next year add another 499, an so on...Does any one have a source for mirror backing safety tape? I have a job coming up in a room that the people are turning into an exercise room.
There is about 150 sq. ft. of mirror. I already ordered the mirror from my glass supplier and then someone told me about putting safety tape on the back.
It seems you can only buy it in large rolls. The smallest roll i found is 666 Sq. Ft. for $275.00. I guess i could ask my glass supper but thought maybe i could buy it on line. I thought maybe i could use some other kind of tape and just criss cross it across the back of the mirror. I would think duct tape might work but wouldn't trust it long term because it seems to dry out over time and not stick so well 

thanks..............nicko"Quality work for those who know the difference"I had a crawl space liner put in my crawl space three years ago and ever since i had it put in i have moisture on my windows that i never had before.
I built my house in 1997 and never had a drop of moisture on my windows until the crawl space liner was put in. In fact it was just the opposite my house was very dry. We would get nose bleeds in the winter and very dry itchy skin. I do not have a dehumidifier installed and my furnace is in the crawl space. My hvac guy cut a section of my fresh air intake out so that maybe my furnace would draw air from the crawl space and send it out the vent pipe. This did not help anything. 

I was looking into having a heat recovery ventilator put in to help with the window moisture but thought since i never had this problem until the crawl space liner was put in that it had to have something to do with the liner.

Anyway hear is my theory..........i am wondering since i took the foundation vents out, even thought i would shut them in the winter they were not air tight. I was thinking that the leaky foundation vents were letting cool dry air into my crawl space that just through the natural stack effect that you have in a house that the cool dry air that was coming in the vents was working its way up into my house and pushing the warm moist air out.

I was thinking to test my theory was to put a few foundation vents back in and slightly open them in the winter to see if the window moisture stops.
What does anyone think of my theory and any other help or theories are welcome.

Thanks...................nicko"Quality work for those who know the difference"Yeah, you're right.

No i did not have excessive moisture but have been reading about crawl space liners for a few years before i had it installed and the technology made sense to me. It wasn't until i was going to put central air in my house and my hvac guy was in my crawl space on a very humid day in the summer and noticed when he ran his hand over my duct work there was a slight bit of condensation on the metal duct. He said it was only going to be worse with cool air running through the ducts on hot humid days. It was at that point i decided to get the liner and it has defiantly helped with that problem. I get no condensation on my ducts when the AC is running in the summer. 

My crawl space is really nice down there. You can take your shoes off down there, it is so bright and clean now. It is a nice crawl space as far as crawl spaces go. It is about four foot high and well lit and very clean.

thanks........nicko"Quality work for those who know the difference"I never feel like I'm cruising through remodels but my subs tell me I knock them out at a good rate. I get about 100 man-hours per week into a kitchen or bath including subs, and 150 or so for larger projects. 

I feel like the clients almost demand this, but my new tile sub, who also is a GC (but just an amazing tile setter so he does sub work) has a different approach. He's the same small size operation, but overlaps 5-8 jobs and takes twice as long on all of them. His work is all magazine worthy, maybe a little different league than me, which helps.

In a lot of ways this would be easier. I sometimes do things out of order to hit the completion date the soonest. Other times me and my employee are stuck waiting on a sub, basically not making money. 

But when people are washing dishes in the bathroom sink and have a fridge in the living room, they can get impatient. Same applies if they are paying $2500 a month to rent a place while I do a major remodel. 

What do you find works best? I haven't been doing this as long as many of you, and I'm first generation, no mentor in all this.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.I think of everything from the clients point of view and how they perceive things.

The thing that makes them the most angry is for something not to be happening for long periods of time. They generally understand when there is a lag waiting for granite after templating etc., but when they are sitting there without a kitchen and nothing is happening at all for more than a week they typically start getting "anxious".

If your tile guy is purposely spreading things out for some reason, I'd find a new tile guy regardless of how good he is.

Yes I make schedules and everyone sticks to them. I'm very good at that. The sub does too, his are just more spread out. I could offer a more spread out schedule at a lower price compared to my fast pace. I can make more money by stacking more jobs. I'll start running it by new clients.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.I do things the same way you do, one at a time and on a quick, tight schedule. Typical kitchen or bath is 6 weeks. I too will do things out of order to keep it moving if needed and am more than flexible. My clients love that I can get it done quickly. I think it helps set me apart from most the guys in my area that take months to do the same thing. I guess I could make more if I did a few at a time, just never how I approached it and was how I learned from the guy I used to work with. I find that after about 8 weeks the "thrill" of the remodel wears off for the client and their attitudes begin to turn no matter how well things are coming out. Everyone wants it done yesterday!If I had your money............


If I just did kitchens. I would get a nice pull trailer customer built with a couple of things. (Or get a new basic one) and modify it to be just a kitchen and dinning room. Have a commercial dish washer gas appliances. Comfortable table and chairs for 8. Pimp it out nicely. Not some camper feel. Service things while it's in use (gray water tank. Or propane levels) as your at the job site. Give as a service option price. Or as a back up to counterpoint an issues during remodel. "The granite from Italy is delayed again. Would it help to have a temporary kitchen and dinning room while we wait?"

Bonus would be to use it up at the lake for the day for a party or what ever. Or tailgate at the game.......

I can do it in 50 hours :whistling. One week solo.:thumbup: Most simple baths take me 3 weeks though. Down to studs, fix framing, new layout etc. But most of my projects are more involved.

My current kitchen, bath, laundry simultaneous remodel is more involved. About 1600 man hours. I'm finishing this week, 9 weeks. I think they're OK with this. Doing them all at once instead of 5, 5 and 2 weeks.

My point is it's hard to compare timeframes since every project is different.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.THIS is a topic that interests me greatly. To me, gutting and renovating an average-sized bathroom is a 1 1/2 to 2 week proposition; an average-sized kitchen a 2 to 3 week proposition. On small projects like that, I work alone, or have and electrician or plumber sub for one full day at most. 

I am currently building a 920 sq ft 2nd floor addition on a brick bungalow, plus complete gut of the 920 sq ft. ground floor. I started demolition on November 6th; by Christmas it was framed, spray foamed, HVAC, electrical and plumbing for three bathrooms and kitchen all done and inspected/passed, exterior stuccoed, interior sheeted and ready for tape/mud (I sub out demolition, framing, electrical, plumbing, HVAC, insulation, drywall hanging and finishing, flooring and exterior finishing; I personally do all trim, tile work, painting and cabinetry installation). As of today the three bathrooms are finished; I am finishing the installation of trim and tomorrow will prepping to spray all the cutting-in for final primer and paint. Entire house will be finish painted by middle of next week; hardwood flooring goes in second half of the week, finished by Friday or Monday. I've told the clients they can move into the upstairs by end January if they wish, i.e., at 2 3/4 months from start of demolition.

To me this is just normal pace. I work eight hours a day as do my subs, no weekend work. To me it is incomprehensible why, outside of a "carriage trade" home, a bathroom would take a month, or a kitchen three months, an addition or whole-house renovation eight months or more. Unless you are overlapping a ton of projects (which just pisses off the client), why would any project take this long?

And how does running a bunch of jobs simultaneously do anything for the bottom line, anyway? The OP mentions a fellow contractor with a "small size operation, but overlaps 5-8 jobs and takes twice as long on all of them." I would love to ask that guy, where is the efficiency in that? What's gained by spending a chunk of each day schlepping tools and equipment from jobsite to jobsite (and another chunk of it explaining to the homeowner why nothing has happened since last month)? If my own experience has taught me anything, it's that there are NO economies of scale in home renovation (otherwise a sole prop like me couldn't compete).JBH said:

To me it is incomprehensible why, outside of a "carriage trade" home, a bathroom would take a month, or a kitchen three months, an addition or whole-house renovation eight months or more. Unless you are overlapping a ton of projects (which just pisses off the client), why would any project take this long?

Because sometimes we do bathrooms that take two guys 5 days just to complete the tile work in a shower.

We have never had a bathroom take a month, but we are on one right now that will be three weeks with two guys there every day not counting the plumber.JBH said:



And how does running a bunch of jobs simultaneously do anything for the bottom line, anyway? The OP mentions a fellow contractor with a "small size operation, but overlaps 5-8 jobs and takes twice as long on all of them." I would love to ask that guy, where is the efficiency in that?

Click to expand...

5 jobs simultaneously but twice as long per job is 5/2, or 250% the overall production and theoretically profit as a GC. The trick would be running 5 at the full speed. Not that hard with the right subs. But being on one site full time really makes things move.

8-10 days for a full gut bathroom is pretty hard, but doable. Pretty limited to premade vanity tops, simple tile, doing drywall and tile at the same time, obviously no heavy glass.

11 weeks for the bigger project is no big deal, but I'd probably take longer than that with 24 man hours a day into it.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.JBH said:



I am currently building a 920 sq ft 2nd floor addition on a brick bungalow, plus complete gut of the 920 sq ft. ground floor. I started demolition on November 6th; by Christmas it was framed, spray foamed, HVAC, electrical and plumbing for three bathrooms and kitchen all done and inspected/passed, exterior stuccoed, interior sheeted and ready for tape/mud (I sub out demolition, framing, electrical, plumbing, HVAC, insulation, drywall hanging and finishing, flooring and exterior finishing; I personally do all trim, tile work, painting and cabinetry installation). As of today the three bathrooms are finished; I am finishing the installation of trim and tomorrow will prepping to spray all the cutting-in for final primer and paint. Entire house will be finish painted by middle of next week; hardwood flooring goes in second half of the week, finished by Friday or Monday. I've told the clients they can move into the upstairs by end January if they wish, i.e., at 2 3/4 months from start of demolition..

Hall bath I tell them 3-5 weeks. Master baths 4-6. I am on week 8 of one right now. It was a chit storm with the stone fabricator.

My typical master bathroom.

2 guys 2 days demo and prep for rough.

Plumber 1-2 days

Electrical 1-2 days

Framing and Drywall 3 days

Tile 2 days for the floor 3-5 days for the shower or tub

Paint 1-2 days (prime, patch, paint)

Cabinets go in right after paint so that the tops can get measured and fabricated and I don't have to do much cutting around them 1 day

Trim and doors 1 day

Tops are 5-10 days after measure, depending on how busy they are. I have been considering having the tops premade depending on the layout. Seems like it would save some time, but then I would have to deal with them on site for a couple of weeks.

Then glass measure the day after the tops are installed

While waiting for the glass the plumber comes in and trims out 1-2 days usually just one, but lately with the stand alone tubs it spills over into day 2.

We hang accessories and then the glass gets installed

A day of clean up and touch ups and we are done.

So min of 20-23 days of work and then there is some lag waiting for a few things here and there. Sometimes the plumber can't make it out the exact day we are ready, but that is the nature of the beast.

We started one ton the 3rd of this month and will start tiling Monday. Should take a week to tile and then another week to finish. That will be a solid 4 week job that has cabinets and tops on site from day one (they had already purchased).

I can't see doing a master gut in less than 4 weeks.

Hall baths average about 3.5 weeks.

But we also run 3-5 jobs at a time.

I currently have 2 bathrooms, a basement and 4-5 other clients with small items to work on. I will start another bathroom in a few weeks and one every 2 weeks after for the foreseeable future.Tried & True on Facebook

Click to expand...I'm right in lin with TNT's work hours and I only use a helper for demo, clean up and when I bring in material. And I start one job and stay on it until it's done. (unless there's a long wait for something special order) 

Before the holidays I did a complete 110sf basement bathroom makeover, down to the studs, tore out the big ugly 1980s corner tub and framed and constructed a 60x36 walk-in shower. I got rid of her dropped ceiling, framed it for drywall, plumbed it, Mud, tape and texture and painted, added some new lighting and switches, new toilet, made her two closets too. I tiled shower and the floor (mid grade material and patterns), installed new vanity/top and all fixtures, towel racks, grab bars, etc etc. I even decorated it and hung pictures and knick-knack things for her. I'm meticulous about keeping track of my hours and had a close 160 hours on it. I work about 35 hours per week so overall it took me close to 5 weeks. Alone 90% of the time. 

She a nice older Jewish gal and is remodeling her basement to live in. She lets her 40 year old mooching-non-working- yogaboy-of-a-son live upstairs. She wants me to build her a small kitchen down there next. 

Most bath and kitchen remodel jobs (complete remods) seem to always run in the 5-8 week range. I'm not looking to win any races and enjoy what I do. I make a point to always keep their rooms somewhat functional if I can and always make sure I have their water and electric back on before I go for the day. I'll even leave the toilet in place until I'm ready for flooring just in case they choose to use . Plus I have a place to take a chit too ! And I'll set up a temporary working kitchen sink where they can wash dishes, etc.

Tile always seems to take me longer than I plan. And then throw in those "unforeseen circumstances" that arise out of freaking nowhere.rrk said:



How long have you been on crack?

Who would want to go outside for the bathroom or the kitchen? answer= no one

Click to expand...

If they had other bathrooms in the house or not living in the home during remodel then a outside unit wouldn't be needed now would it. But the thread isn't asking about empty homes.

So customer with one bath type house is fine without bathroom for a week?........but they want the nice tile shower and heated floor!

Alot of houses here with one bath so it's always a challenge.

Sure people can do without a kitchen for a while but they are always put out with interrupting the program of Dailey life.


That's why people are falling for that bathroom in a day program. The do an overlay of crap on everything. Plastic liners on tubs and horse**** like that. The volume of online complaints is amazing.

Where I am there are only a few contractors doing 100k kitchen remodels. The rest of the area are people who bought a 150k to 200k house 10 to 20 years ago. Tell them the remodel will be more then 20k and they faint. No one is buying a 300k house today and putting a 100k kitchen in it.

Here things take longer then usual. Smaller pool of quality subs and their priority is small commercial jobs and 100k kitchens. So either wait on their list to get them or do the work yourself. Either takes a little longer to do. But things may be different in your area.The owner here decided after the tile went down he wanted a larger vanity/sink combo and so it turns out, the original plumbing rough will not work once I laid out the new cabinet 

The original contractor on this job stopped work in early July due to personal reasons I won't disclose and the owner was on the hunt for somebody to complete it...not usually my bag of tea, but because he is a good friend of a very good friend of mine (the one who referred me) I had to take a look. 

The plumbing rough has to be moved for the sink, a new cabinet with shelving and a laundry chute was custom made and needs installation in the shower wet wall alcove area, a new toilet is to be installed, a new recessed medicine cabinet, shower doors, shower valve fixtures, grab bars, robe hooks, a door needs to be shaved, new moldings, light fixture, wall/ceiling finish and some fresh paint.

I bid it T&M and the owner gracefully agreed...he just want's it done at this stage."Under promise, over deliver and all that!" JBM

https://www.facebook.com/Superseal-Construction-162699413750013/So the next step here at the bathroom job is to install the glass doors. The customer ordered Dreamline "Enigma X" last year and has had them sitting under a tarp outside on a skid ever since. I go to open the box and it's completely deteriorated all the way around from being soaking wet. I get to the instructions and they're a moldy mess that I can barely read. After i completely unpackage everything and do a parts check, I'm surprised to see everything in pretty good shape...if only I could read the instructions on the million and one parts that come with it...

No matter, I basically figure everything out with help from my smart phone and begin the installation.

Just so happens my nephew swings by to give me a hand with the 3/8" thick tempered glass panels and says, "they look like they're too small"...As soon as my brain registers what he said, I immediately realized the customer ordered the wrong door a year ago and that I already cut the main glide bar to fit the enclosure. Long story short, these are the wrong height doors and they're not going to work...I called the customer with the bad news and he signed off quick that we need to order the rights ones pronto...his loss unfortunately.

Next up is the shower valve trim, it's keeps getting better I tell ya...I run to my plumbing house to pick up a trim plate and some handles, Moen model "Kingsley", a chrome wall supply elbow and what ever else I need to complete the install and I start. I begin by removing the protective plastic caps over the previously installed Moen #3350 2 function transfer valve and I find the valve is out of plumb by 5/8" of an inch which will surely transfer over to the handles and trim plate. The valve was also off on it's depth setting actually protruding through the wall preventing a flush fit with the trim cover and tile wall. Since everything else was going wrong why not add the drop ear elbows that supply the rain head and handheld were not aligning with the drill holes in the tile....hence, it all had to be ripped out and done again.

To top it all off, I get things to a point where I can turn on the water service and I get a severe drip from the transfer valve body that I had nothing to do with...I pull it out, grease it up and the leak has slowed to a drop every 20 min. or so so I may need to replace a brand new valve stem right out of the gate...not completely unusual, as these things damage very easy if debris is not flushed from the lines or the plumber doesn't pull the cartridges when he's torching close to them.
Anyhow, all the fixtures are now in including the LED Rozin 16" rain head, hand held shower head slide bar and a couple of DMI grab bars.

https://www.facebook.com/Superseal-Construction-162699413750013/Hello,

I'm a contractor in So Cal. 

I have a client that wants me to run a duct through the ceiling inbetween the second and third floor. It's an exhaust for a dryer.

There's an exhaust for a bathroom that runs parallel to the line I would need to run, so I'm hoping the joists are consistent over that 10'. 

My question is: what are the chances that I would run into blocking/other obstructions as I'm trying to run the ducting inbetween the joists?

I have done some work like this, but not a ton. 

In the pictures you can see where the dryer is, where the bathroom and other exhaust fan is, where the bathroom exhaust vent is, and where the dryer exhaust vent would go. 

I did peek in the can lights but did not pull one to see the joists etc. I could do this if I return. 

Any suggestions are much appreciated! 

L 

PS I decided to post in remodel instead of HVAC, as it has more to do with the joists/blocks etc. If I should move to HVAC, please let me know. I just joined.No way to know.
Why isn't there one already?

Been there, done that. First stop is Condo association. Be prepared for mucho bool sheet.He might be a small town guy but thats good big time advise take it :thumbsup:Still "Shakin" the tree bossHope you and the client like drywall work... 

If there's an HOA, start with them. HOAs have no shortage of nosy neighbors that'll put a monkey wrench in your plans... better to understand what you're up against beforehand. Plus, if you're lucky, you might get building plans.

Then offer a t&m contract to do exploratory holes in the ceiling. (Promise nothing except holes in the ceiling!) Try to establish if there's a beam perpendicular to the joists or anything else that's going to give you trouble.Hi Everyone,

Thanks so much for the advice! Very helpful.

I will give him some thoughts, plus a proposal for investigative work. 

Luckily, his unit is the one above the floor, so we don't have to deal with upstairs neighbors.

Yours,

LAlso - I have a question: 

For investigative work, my thought is to drill a small hole where the vent would be, and then run a fish line through and see how far it goes without obstruction. 

Then, I could fill the hole with sikaflex etc. once we're done. 

Is that better than starting with cutting holes in drywall?

Yours,

LYou need to get a set of the new Makita X-ray vision glasses. Most of my clients don't understand why I dont have a set either.
Last week did a dog door to exterior set everything up got it perfect height in the stud bay perfect. 
Cut out most of the sheetrock and right there 3 gas lines. 
I guess what I am trying to say is you could get your liner all the way to the exterior wall then run into something.Anderson said:

Thanks Pangdev. I appreciate it!Goodmorning All! 

We have a successful rehabbing business in Dallas/Fort Worth Texas but are expanding into new markets and our 1st expansion will be in the Minneapolis area. I'm looking for some insight on the pricing, subs, market, clientele, etc. We only do flip houses, but I've heard that the market here isn't that great for flipping and that we may need to turn to retail remodeling work in this area. The reason for the move to this location is for family reasons, but our other locations will be for market reasons. We have contacts set up all over the country to feed us work, but Minneapolis is not one of the better markets in house flipping from what I can tell. I've called around for pricing and some people are hesitant to give it out, though I've never been that type of person. I am mainly concerned with cabinets, flooring/tile, paint, sheetrock, and general labor.

I am an open book for advice and I am hoping to run into some guys on here that are like minded. Have a great day!Pricing questions are frowned upon here as a rule, too many market variables for any worthwhile discussion. 

When you call around for pricing are you asking about specific projects or trying to get general pricing?Isn't Tipitop from that area? 

He could give you pricing maybe.Just curious in what product everyone else was using. One of my trim guys uses a caulk that doesn't agree with paint, another uses something that shrinks like crazy and the 3rd uses something like acrylic spackle that is sandpaper resistant. 

I've just realised that this a bottom line issue for the painters.

Minwax makes a white putty which is just like thier colored stuff and we just used that recently and it works pretty well. 

All of these are soft and remain so for a while. I would only recommend for small nail holes and very small gaps.

For larger problem areas on painted surfaces we use auto body filler. Put in on heavy, and slice it off with a very sharp chisel before it gets too hard, then sand smooth. Shrinkage won't be a problem.

Caulk on nail holes usually leaves the owner's fingerprint on the wood.:thumbdownI've switched to vinyl spackling for nail holes. Dries fast, very easy to sand.

www.completecustomremodeling.comI agree filling holes should be the painters job,however if you care what the finished product looks like don't count on the painter. best bet is to do a neat trim job and use brads where possible. (Smaller holes.) Bondo for the big gaps is preferable. spackle works or anything HD has cheap for the small holesSure, slap it up, bang it full of holes and then HOPE the painter is going to do a good job of filling YOUR holes before he paints. I know that in a lot of areas, the painter is expected to fill the holes...however, my contention would be "Why would you trust someone else to do that?" If he does a crappy job, it's a reflection on your work as well as his.

I did not look at the proposal till i got home. He wrote in that the payments are starting 2 weeks after my proposed start date.
I just finished a 13k project for him at his second house. Job went well, the clients did not cause any problems. I can afford to wait for the money, but i will end up partially financing the cabinets/countertops(13k allowance)

Here is the question; should i wait 2 weeks for a second payment, or revise the terms again?

This is my first time handling the cabinet/countertops purchase, which makes up such a large portion of the sales price. Also, i am sure the allowance is not going to cover what the wife wants for cabinets now. I assume i will ask for more money when the cabinets are ordered.

I work alone, and am only subbing elec.

Cabinets and counter tops get paid in full before ordering. What happens when they change their mind, your stuck with the cabinets?

Or just change the start date 2 weeks so it matches the payments. :thumbsup:I would not alter my payment structure. Maybe a conversation about why he is apprehensive and why you set them up the way you do. 


When people ask I say "I have altered my terms once in the past and soon came to regret it." I say it that way because it true and more importantly I like to let customers know when they are sending red flags. 

In fact if I knew a customer would ask such a question I would screw the payments for even more money on the begging phases and possible even increase price to cover an added risk of a customer who might not make final payment.There's a reason they are called terms of the agreement... if he is allowed to re-write them at will, with no agreement on your part, what part can't he re-write?

You already showed good faith towards an existing customer and acquiesced once and agreed to the new terms... BS for him to pull this and IMHO something you should call him out (professionally) on for the very reason you stipulated... you can afford to wait but you're not his bank and affects your cashflow and not what you re-agreed to...You cut your balls off (professionally) when you allow a client to change anything in a contract.

Lancaster, PA Fence ContractorNo matter what the job is if I have to order something that I can't return I collect in full for that item before it is ordered. For a kitchen you could get stuck with $20k in cabinets for a lot of reasons. Other than that I usually write the payment terms where I will be paid roughly every 2 weeks.for higher dollar projects we will break it down to 1/3 when work begins 1/3 middle 1/3 upon completion. if necessary for the client.

typically 1/2 at start and 1/2 upon completion the only way to goI do a basic breakdown on any job and the # of payments will depend on the job cost. So if its a kitchen the 1st payment at signing of contract will cover total cost of the cabinetry + 10%

So the basic break-up on the kitchen would be in 4 payments and the total job cost (material-labor-overhead-profit) gets paid up in the first 1-3 payments and the remaining balance is always around $500 or whatever you want to leave at the end.I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​A lot of good advice.

I am not sure how you missed him rewriting the terms. When I sign a contract, every page and part is gone over, signed and copies made.

I will also say that I would suggest the following on your terms.

Deposit to hold the schedule: 5% of the project.

Any special order: 100% of the charge paid in full prior to order (cabinets, tile, tops, plumbing). I won't eat their finishes.

Deposit to start: 20% of the remaining balance leaving 80% to be split into four payments.

Progress payment (Define benchmark you need to reach in order to get payment) Usually I do something like the project demoed, electric and plumbing rough complete: another 20%

Progress payment - drywall ready to paint, cabinets installed: another 20%

Progress payment - tops installed, walls painted: another 20%

Progress payment - backsplash installed, plumbing and electric trimmed: another 20%

Final payment - majority completed (sometimes I allow a hold back for small punch list items): Final 20%Tried & True on Facebook

You definitely need to cover as many basis that are truly necessary. You have to be careful not to get bogged down in the fine print.

Customers will pick you apart if something doesnt go their way. 

Some will, but this is where your qualification process is important. Selecting clients that trust you is important.
Also building trust from the first handshake to the signing of the first deposit check you are building a relationship that should allow for some trust on their part. Also knowing how to address and deescalate a nickpick is key.

You can do 100 thing perfect and as soon as the most minute issue arrises, then you will see them cut you down.

See above. My thought is that if you have built a solid relationship with the client, the 100 things matter. The one is understood. For instance, I just finished a bathroom. I get a call the next day with the dreaded, there is a spot on my ceiling below the bathroom

My contracts are 20+ pages. Not saying you need that yourself however it needs to be in writing.

20 plus pages is too much, IMO. Mine is somewhere around 9 and I am going to cull that down. You can't cover everything and even if you do, you have to have a court rule in your favor. So a contract really is only a guide to help keep honest people honest.

Just add a SOW clause. No need for all the fine print.

This isn't really legally enforceable. Negligence is Negligence. No one can sign away their rights to you or your guys causing damage just because they left their care in the drive. These are the types of things that bulk up your contract and really aren't enforceable.

There is a good chance that it had intermediate support beams that rotted or had insect damage and were replaced. People weren't above using green beams when they built, then the powder post beetles come along, and it goes down hill from there....hdavis said:

Going back to studs can open other cans of worms - you just don't need some of those kinds of surprises. Insulation on these are typically best blown - drill and fill.

Shimming the walls if they're pretty far out isn't such a bad thing - the finish quality can still be good, but there is the issue of jamb extensions.Yeah we will now have fatter door jambs, and shorter trim because we are recycling the original trim.

I'm an IT admin for a pretty big commercial remodeling company here in Oregon. I have noticed that my employer has to take a lot of "before and after photos" of remodeling work he does. Especially for dry-rot. Then there has to be a report created where I drag and drop the photos into a word processor and add the notes for the image. Oregon has a 10 year law and some crazy wet weather. It seems that insurance companies will love you if you have documented image evidence. 

So I was thinking of creating an app solution specifically for this need. What I'm trying to find out if anyone else here would use this app. I plan on building it on Amazons AWS elastic cloud. It would have a web interface as well and would auto create a pdf report with the notes for each individual image. All process I had to deal with. 

There will be no ads. I hate that ***** and they eat alot of processing power which slows the app. 

I will offer it free because I will get paid from the free trial storage from Dropbox. I'm not looking to making money of the app, I'll be happy if it pays for itself. I want to add this app to my resume but I need a lot of people to use it so it can utilize the full capacity of Amazons AWS cloud. 

So if you would like to be apart of the app you could register your email here: https://goo.gl/forms/GBUo1V4ArovQj95x2 
I will only email you when the app is ready to be used. 

This form will also let me know how many people would actually be interested in it. 

If you dont want to leave your email address please just respond to this post if you would use the app.I would probably be able to use an app like that , have you made any progress?i can see a lot of potential here and would be willing to try it out. Are you still working on this project?Sounds like a great idea

LF pricing is based on the base specs of the cab style/finish... adding drawers, components, moldings, etc. are added on/extra... typically seen by the average customer in most Big Box or stand alone stores or their advertisements...

You have to be careful how some actually use the term LF as well...I cant seem to come up with a reliable linear foot package on installing if thats what we are talking about.

I price based on the whats being done in the kitchen. So is it a 3 day install, a one week kitchen a 7 day kitchen...etc...

So many things would need to be added to the base install cost that its not worth it....panels, light baffle, layers of fascia, crown, corbels, toe kicks, toe kick cut outs, are they boxes or face frame? How much hardware?Leo G said:

Same way I do it. Draw it, put cost to the pieces, add build/finish labor, add day(s) necessary to install.

Once the cost has been calculated, pretty easy to convert to LF price.

Just be sure that the other guy did the same so it's in context... two ways it could alter the perception if he didn't...1. He gave a lineal foot price for the base/standard cab but did not include the extra's (i.e. - more drawers, susans, cutlery dividers, garbage/recycle, moldings, pull-outs, etc.).

2. He measured the top and bottom separately and then divided by 12 so there's more feet to the lineal so it makes the lineal foot price seem lower... it's an on-going debate, because some say if you don't do it that way, then you pay for breaks in the cabinet line (i.e. - appliances, shorter cabs, windows) and lose money on others (i.e. - corner cabs, pantries)...​Seen many variations over the years, so when a customer mentions lineal foot, we delve a little deeper into what they think that means as it's been explained to them by someone else...TNTSERVICES said:

A LF price is a sales tactic to lure the client in with low cost. Home Depot and Lowe's advertise this way. There is no possible way to quote cabinets without all the details of each cabinet, i.e; wood species, finish, door style, frame style, moldings and accessories. Add-on's can double the cost of the boxes.

When you divide the cabinet cost as you said you did into the LF, you are still not comparing apples to apples. Compare products, not LF for the sale. Hope this helps.If he is asking for a whole house remodel / Flip, then they probably will be "lower" end cabinets that are not custom. If you know your vendor get a price sheet and price it out. He likely has a contractor who does a lot of flips bidding who knows what his cabinet vendor costs are.GKing Construction | Kitchen and bathroom remodelingAnyone got any suggestions??

So the Sheetrock coming off weather I like it or not, the ceiling and exterior walls are easy, it's where they foamed from the back side that's hard.... don't ever underestimate the strength of foam,If you could make a few vertical channels and remove the screws some how, maybe a guitar string or wire behind with dowels on the ends for handles and sort of wire saw it off. 
That's a dilly of a pickle though.Why not use a demo hammer, damage some foam, then fix the foam?

I'm approaching it from a "time is money" view though. I know foam ain't cheap, but damn it sure looks like your doing it the slowest way possible.

Another idea: the bent sawzall blade trick.www.callbathdoctor.comI would run an electric carving knife behind it, 6" at a time, remove as you go down the wall.

Or find a serrated sword. :jester:I'm not a big fan of adding a 2nd layer of sheetrock. However in your situation it seems like a reasonable option. If the wall is half stripped pads the studs and overlay the rest.Driftweed said:

Demo hammer does work, but I didn't have the right chisel, wished I had a floor scraper, or a curved tile chisel, nobody in town had one, we don't have a lot of options as far as just go to the next lumberyard,

That said, my preferred weapon was a small pick, or a small straight blade adze, then in the tight spots clean up with demo hammer 

Yes there will be foam repair, if it was easier to take all the foam out with the drywall, I would have done that, using the sawzall was a tedious joke!!

I just got a little section to finish yet, 👍🏻 it's not so bad once you just put your head down and do it.

I'll take some pics when I finish it on Monday,Did you try dynamite?

This was built in early 2000's, it was plastered with color mixed in it to look like 70's, unfortunately it was a chitty job, with the changes we are making some areas need to be accessed.... hence the removal,I would use an oscillating saw and biggest blade you can get. 3" inchs at a time.... talk about tedious.

I have to ask my foam guy, but this kinda looks like it may have been sprayed a bit to thick??









It had a lot of that, most places had 4 or 5" I think may have been sprayed in one pass

Tools that were tried








Pick and long handled chisel were favoriteHi, I am from Toronto, ON. My husband and I have decided to renovate our kitchen. We have been thinking it for the past 6-8 months. Our House was built by my father in law. This house is his wedding gift for us.
For now, it is just the kitchen that we have decided to renovate. As I told you the house is old and has a lot of kitchen appliances. We have two children, one is a toddler. Since we have a toddler in our house we were thinking of Storing our kitchen appliances to some indoor Storage space, as it could ease our renovation process. 
But the thing is, I don’t know how much time this renovation could take and where I could find a Storage space at a reasonable and affordable price. So, if there is anyone who’ve done this before, please share your ideas for the kitchen renovation. And if you could share any indoor storage space near Toronto that would be a great help.Thanks for posting on ContractorTalk.com.

We apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused. This thread has been closed.We splurged a little while ago and remodeled our kitchen. A good bit was self performed including purchasing all new kitchenaid appliances from sears (online). Some of them seemed better than others, but we were the most impressed with the new gas range. Super heavy, seemed to be the forever stove we wanted. 

Exactly one year and two weeks after purchase, This July, the touch screen and module went out. It was an expensive repair. Sears repair people came out for a diagnostic with a fee. They ordered the part shipped to us and came for a second trip to install. I wasn't there for the installation part. The touch screen worked fine, but we kept getting a blower error message. They finally came back for a second diagnostic and ordered a blower. 

Yesterday they came to install the blower. After at least three hours, the repair man finally got it put back together. I walked over to turn the oven on to test and once it heated up the fan started squealing. The repair man says he hopes it will quiet down in a minute and sure enough it does. Today the fan is making what are more like rumbling noises. I assume bearings are bad. Long story short, I'm pissed. I've got almost as much in repairs as the (fairly pricey) unit cost to begin with. As soon as it breaks again, I want to be prepared for war.

What party is the most productive one to deal with, Sears or Whirlpool/Kitchenaid?

I assume both have regional sales reps, How do I go about contacting? Warranty phone number on my paperwork goes straight to India.

To be honest, at this point, I don't even care about the money. I am just ready to set somebody straight and hopefully find the stove I actually need.Bill Baddorf

If you bought it online, then unfortunately it might be you against the entire internet and their lazy phone operators.

Never had an issue with KitchenAid products, but I would suggest you blow up their phone lines and keep getting higher and higher people until you get it resolved. 

Document everything and every name and ID you speak with and keep a word document journal.

That's about it I wouldn't have seen it at all but I had to skim coat the whole house they had paneling on every wall and removing it damaged the drywall because of the glue Nails Etc..
And then they came up with the idea to spray foam in the walls facing Lake Huron. So as I was removing it I've noticed it along the bottom foot for about 3 or 4 feet. I appreciate any information on what someone else might do. I would obviously remove it and Doucet real good with microban. Right to wait till it stops raining and peel back the siding on the exterior see if I can find anything else that may have made this happened. Also in the crawl space. Thanks again

Isn't there some sort of form realtors have that states if anyone has ever had any knowledge of mold on the property?

Realtors really have nothing to do with it. Lawyers do. If there is an issue where the mold needs to be remediated(for whatever reason) or someone is suffering from health issues due to the mold, then the insurance company that is footing the bill for either of those situations is going to look for someone else to pay the tab. If you, as a professional service provider, have tampered with the area, knowing that there is mold present, then you are probably going to be involved in the lawsuit. Because it's unlikely that your insurance covers you for mold remediation, they will be going directly after your personal assets.

At least that's my understanding of the usual scenario. I have worked in this field before and had extensive conversations with litigation attorneys and various people within the insurance field but that doesn't mean I have it exactly right.Jaws;1780140 said:



Planer.....

Click to expand...Good day to you all...

I have some conflicting reviews on this topic, and thought I would bring it here.

On a bathroom remodel, we have pulled the tub, vanity and existing tile. The existing floor is two layers of subfloor, but both are particle board. 

My current plan is to remove the top layer and replace it all with hardy board... and then here starts my questions.

1) I have only heard one person say that they glue the hardy board to the lower sub-floor later, this sounds crazy, I would use many screws to make sure there is no squeeking.

2) The most important question I have, for the shower stall, I am planning a curbless entry with a forward slope to the shower doors. I am using the QuickdrainUSA product which so far seems like a good way to go. I am using their 58" linear drain and their quickslope product and the kit they supply for waterproofing.
Their instructions report to put thin-set directly to the plywood, then lay backerboard (I assume hardy) , then right onto the hardy a layer of thinset and then their quickslope material.

I have in the past been under the impression that you should always place tar-paper with mesh on top of the plywood, and then any cement / thin-set or mortar or anything like that otherwise the wood just draws all the moisture from the thin-set.

Does anyone here have any view on these questions?

ThanksPull both layers of particle board. 

Install 3/4" T&G

Install additional ply depending on joust span

Install 1/4" backer per manufacturers instructions (thinset then screw every 6")

As for the shower FOLLOW THE MANUFACTURERS INSTRUCTIONS.Tried & True on Facebook

If you need to install a second subfloor layer, it is advised that you NOT attach the second layer to the floor's joists.

only the section under the old tub was two layer of particle board - 3/8th and then 3/4.

I think you're on the right track. I primarily drink the Schluter Kool-Aid (Ok let's hear it...get it all out of your systems) so I'm more familiar with the Ditra installation referenced above. I've always done a 3/4" T&G subfloor with an underlayment before I lay Ditra. Although I believe for 16 O.C., Schluter only calls for a single layer 3/4" subfloor minimum. 

On your Durock, it should only be a layer straight over the subfloor as noted by the manufacturer. I'm thinking that Durock over Hardi-board is a little overkill. Not to mention that with all of that plus two layers of subfloor, mortar and tile you're going to dang near build a staircase at the threshold to make up for the drop. Here are the Durock installation instructions I found...like I said, I don't install much of it so I'm not as familiar as some.

All panels should always go with the face grain going perpendicular to joists. Forget tar paper and glue. 

Pulling both layers of plywood would be the best but depending on how stiff the joists are framed, I would have no problem with 3/8" stapled to 3/4" particle board. Screws into particle board would not be the method I would choose.

I would waterproof the plywood areas with two coats Red Gard or Aqua Defense or a flat membrane. You could Ditra and cover the seams with Ditra band if you like that better.jb4211 said:

Why would he consult the ditra installation handbook when he plainly said he was installing Hardie board?

Here's my two cents.....

As you said you were gonna do, remove both the sub-floor and underlayment of particle board.
Install your 3/4" plywood if you like but I use 3/4" Sturdi-floor which is an engineered t&g (OSB type) of board and it's a great product.... you'll NEVER have a squeek, and because it's an engineered product it's naturally 200% more water-proof than plywood.
The manufacturer says to use thinset under your Hardie. I used to but I haven't for several years and I'm yet to have a problem. It won't do anything but make it stronger if you do use it. 

Here's where you and I differ.... I use Durock instead of Hardie. I use 1/2" on walls and 1/4" on floors. I also thinset all joints without tape and I use a roll on moisture barrier like AquaDefense. It is an AWESOME product. :The reason I use Durock is because I find it a lot easier to work with. Yes, they both create a lot of dust, but the Durock cuts a lot faster and doesn't "blow out" on the edges if you get the screw too close. It's a preference on mine. You may prefer otherwise.

I hate Ditra, btw. I think it's terribly expensive and since I'm not having problems with the way I use Durock, then, it can't be better, only different. (and more expensive)

Good luck to you!KermieB said:

I don't agree with almost your whole post.
I especially don't agree with doing the opposite of what the manufacture instructs you to do when installing their product.

But, that's just my opinion. What do I know?JonYou guys are trying to cover too many things. No floor is all particle board, osb maybe , but ,not two layers of particle board. Subfloor construction and backer installation are different things....and the shower is another area or difficulty entirely, especially since barrier free. Waterproof is like pregnant...either you are or you aren't. This whole thread is typical of wet area set up misconception s and misunderstandings brought about by too many systems and choices , and guys trying to put it all together. Sadly, the manufacturers are often misguided as well.The way I do it is, pull up everything and get yourself down to subfloor. reshoot the subfloor with ring shank nails and then depending on the thickness of the subfloor and span of the joists add another layer of ply and glue and shoot that down. Then mud the floor with versa bond and install 1/2 hardie backer.Evan Daniels

Evan, that's a poor excuse for doing the opposite of what's recommended. 

I think it's best to never subscribe to that mindset, "that's the way I've always done it." You may have been doing it wrong all along.

Just my opinion, but I try and adhere to the recommend installation methods from either the manufacture or the governing authority on the subject. I also, try and stay open minded to better ways of doing something.

One thing I've learned from this site, is being opened minded is the best practice. You don't have to necessarily agree with someone else, but being open minded in considering other methods or materials only makes you more informed and a better contractor. Just my thoughts.Jonjb4211 said:

One thing I've learned from this site, is being opened minded is the best practice. You don't have to necessarily agree with someone else, but being open minded in considering other methods or materials only makes you more informed and a better contractor. Just my thoughts.

got a client with an open beam over-hang right by the pool
the wood ledger is supported by 2-1/2 inch steel posts , cemented into the pool curb .
all of them are severely rusting out at the bottom because of the chlorine .( I`m sure most of you have seen this)

she wants them replaced with stainless steel posts .I`m thinking its over-kill.
she has one replaced with galvanized ,but its rusting a bit too.

any thoughts of installing the steel or galvanized , but first " sleeving "it with a typical pvc pipe to prevent the rusting ?
that sleeve could also go right into the cement .

or will I be able to put a rust-proof primer and paint that will actually hold up over the years
.

I don`t think I`ve even seen metal posts by a pool that weren`t rusted out on the bottom

My brother and I started a remodeling company 6 months ago. I’m well versed in marketing and generating leads and he is a phenomenal carpenter/builder.

The prices were bidding generate the profit we expect after costs. Once we get a project, getting it completed and getting paid seems relatively smooth.

We’re at a bit of a snag with the amount of time we spend writing each individual estimate. We try to be as detailed as possible and account for everything but it seems to be the most time consuming process of this operation.

I would truly appreciate some feedback on how some of you contractors that bid remodeling jobs (or any larger size jobs) streamline your sales process and do so without spending too much time on one prospect without getting a down payment.

I don't do any of the above if they ask me to itemize I've lost interest in getting the job the job is bid as a whole.

I certainly don't want to rush through an estimate. One thing I try and do is get as detailed as possible during the initial meeting in areas where the options are the clients choice. It doesn't take me long to figure labor, it can be a pain figuring materials if I don't use them often, can't get them online or don't have a price list.

With remodeling every job is different so there's really no way to streamline the estimating process on labor. You can start with a sq. ft. price on each phase but that's about it.

What I find most contractors miss is job accessibility, parking,storing materials and tools, access to entrance, pets, etc.This is the body of an email I sent a client the morning after our first meeting. 

They asked about a couple of extra's we did not discuss in the meeting. 

Once they agree to the scope they're emailed an estimate. 

I included an estimate showing the cost of the cabinets based on a hybrid design he had from 2 other suppliers. They won't get my design unless they sign the design/build contract. 

Instead of listing all the stuff included, I use a clause that states if something is not specifically listed it is not included.

Yes. Talk money early. Tell them will email within 24 hours a ballpark. If it's in their budget, provide a detailed bid. Charge for bids over X amount. For me, it's over $100k or so.



Twisted_Monk said:

Click to expand...

Never itemize price. Clearly list everything that's included, and give the price. Possibly with a few options that add or reduce it, but not a detailed itemization. I for one know I sometimes lose money on parts of a project and make more than expected on other parts. At the end, I'm within a couple %. This is why I can't itemize, and this is what I tell the clients. 



Twisted_Monk said:

No.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.Thank you for the feedback,

This info is helpful.Michigan Remodeling ContractorI do exactly as goldenview says. Rough estimate if they want one, then after they accept give a more detailed one. Most times i usually get clients who always want to change things around at the last minute so I hand them a change order. Never itemize.I usually meet in person, at the project, for at least an hour to go over the project. I will submit an estimate (itemized) with pricing that i tell them is ballpark. If they like the initial estimate, and let me know they want to go with me, then i will return for a detailed estimate. As an example this is when i would return and actually begin to put together a cabinet layout for their kitchen, price their tile, etc, and really put in the time for their project.... because i have essentially gotten the project and want to have my estimate turn into a quote/contract. On initial estimates i spend around 20-30 minutes to turn my notes into the $ figure based on an itemized excel spreadsheet. I have preset sqft-based pricing that i try to use for all aspects of the estimate, and it works well to keep my 'ballpark' pretty close to the actual contracted price.GKing Construction | Kitchen and bathroom remodelingMy sister wants her bathroom remodeled but cake across this and want to know what it is

Well and septic regulations were way different in 1955, most places now have regulations about how close a well can be to a septic system leach field. Septic systems now require engineering everywhere I'm familiar with.

Is this a house you are looking to buy?

Your question about the septic is so over the top basic, that it leads me to seriously doubt whether you actually work in the trades.

Does anyone here know a supplier that can get short run orders with white, low profile spacers?.

I know some will ask, so- Yes, I am sure they're white, anodized (maybe even powder coat, although I doubt it) aluminum spacers.

http://lrgwood.com
Custom Cabinets in Hartford County ConnecticutIn New England, on most higher end homes, architects will spec mahogany for exterior millwork for it's superior weather resistance; I've made many exterior doors and sash from mahogany that gets painted as are these doors. Interior is a linen white that's been custom glazed, exterior is a BM Crown Point Sand. So,white is the better color for the spacers, mill finish will show more and anodized bronze tone is out of the question
The weather strips and saddle are real bronze, so they have slightly tarnised brass appearance- and they don't show when the doors are closed anyway.
This company carries what I'm talking about- http://kilianhardware.com/thresac.htmlCall these guys, I believe they assemble there glazing. Ask them if the can have the spacers anodized white prior to assembly of the IGU.

Sent from my SM-G930V using TapatalkHi guys,

I'm remodeling a bathroom. I had my cabinet maker build a corner linen cabinet and a vanity which attaches to the vanity on the right. The counter top will run into the linen cabinet. I've designed the linen cabinet 2" deeper than the vanity so the front of the counter top flushes out with the front of the cabinet (not the cabinet doors). I've always ordered cabinets this way, whether they're custom or semi-custom from Diamond, DuraSupreme or whatever. 

My customer is saying this is an error and needs to be fixed. I've explained the reason for this being done and I'm waiting to hear back from her, but I thought I'd ask you guys to weigh in on whether what I've done is considered proper or not. I'll likely show her your responses. Thanks in advance and happy Easter!She has the money she makes the rules.

Write up a change order that increases the price appropriately and she can decide how right she is.

Sent from my SM-N910T using TapatalkYou could reduce the overhang of the top to meet the face of the linen cab and vanity door, but depends on overall design doesn't always look right IMHO (part of the reason is knobs/pulls will extend beyond top edge), as countertops generally have an overhang for a reason... if she maintains a standard overhang, she will either have the countertop sit proud of the linen cab face if she wants the vanity and linen cab faces to align, or she needs to keep it as is...

If you don't have it already, another option is to do a return on the top where the vanity and linen cab meet if the cabs align... , but all this should have been covered in drawings that she signs off on...

Whatever you/she decides be sure to provide drawings and get her to sign off on it BEFORE implementing the change...

Picture?It worked out. After I explained the reasons for doing it this way they understood. They're quite happy with the bathroom and have offered to be enthusiastic references.

We did provide elevations and a plan of the cabinets, but that doesn't mean questions don't get asked. My custom cabinet maker doesn't do CAD, he's old school. 

Hopefully the pictures attach correctly. One is of the vanity and linen cab, the others are of the bathroom overall. It's a cramped space so pictures were difficult.We have about a 25' run in a basement bath, through ceiling joists, which takes (2) 90 degree bends along the way.

My experience is that venting for moisture, wherever there is drywall, should be sheet metal. I've replaced this foil coil in short runs (through accessible attics) that develop pinholes and slits in it, after a short number of years.

Not only is sheet metal sturdier, it is better shaped for internal moisture (no "continuous wire" catches).

Anyone using this for reasons beside cost and ease of install?Don't much care for the aluminum stuff; too delicate and generally a PITA to work with.

I prefer insulated plastic esophagus. Tough, flexible and a heck of a lot easier than rigid sheet metal. Plus, you really ought to have that insulation.Tinstaafl said:

I don't think so. Anyone who understands Viglink knows it's installed by the forum owners to squeak out a bit more ad revenue. He was just commenting on the fact it's installed here.Definitely want a booster with a 25' run and 2 90's...................Only being a bath fan, I don't think the length is much of a factor if the flexible duct is stretched out properly and ran with as few bends as possible. Of course, one would like to keep the run shorter. We only use the insulated flex duct for bath fans. If done right, there has never been an issue. The aluminum flex is garbage, imo. 
I would never use it for a dryer vent or range hood vent but bath fans are usually pretty light, CFM wise. In any of our new construction, we are recommending HRV's be installed as well so there is some dehumidification and constant air exchange without too much energy loss. Air exchange has become a big code issue up here in BC. The inspectors are all over it.ChatsworthCA123 said:

I Have been working on a kitchen remodel that I thought was going really well. Until yesterday. So a bit of an overview, Early on we came across a cracked main sewer line running under their kitchen when we were moving and installing some new plumbing lines. This happened on a Friday afternoon. At the time the clients were very understanding and grateful we found and fixed a major issue. (We had to jack up the concrete running through the kitchen, install a new sewer line, and repair the concrete.) Now though, he stated to me yesterday that his "first red flag should have been when I found a problem on a Friday afternoon and didn't work through the weekend to fix it" and that everyone he's talked to has validated that. I genuinely am trying to gage if I should have stayed through the weekend with the crew to fix this? Any one else have policies or approaches about issues such as this?

Next, we built custom cabinets for the clients. We have not by any means finished them yet or have claimed to finish them. We actually have explained to them they aren't finished yet, and the whole kitchen still needs the punch list of finishing touches and such to be done.

We were away for a week and a half, them
Knowing this would happen were
Seemingly okay with it; because I got married and had a honeymoon planned. We left them with a fully functioning kitchen, and an explanation that a,b and c still needed to be finished up.

The day of my wedding the client texted me awful and rude things. Then while we were away they took it upon themselves to try and finish some stuff themselves and make a punch list of everything that needed to be touched up and finished off (i.e.: cabinet paint final coat, wall touch ups, etc). I've tried to be understanding and receptive to their complaints because I am sure living with an unfinished kitchen (even though it's fully functioning) can be upsetting. So I've been tolerant and validating and have assured him that all of this stuff we already intended to make sure was finished properly when we got back. No problem. Then yesterday, the client informs me they've been unhappy the entire renovation, among many other things (mostly about how he's trying not to "go off on me", etc). This was a bit of a shock to me because throughout the entire process, I've stayed in communication with him and his wife every step of the way and they have told us how much they are loving where the renovation is going, how excited they are, etc.

At this point, I feel that clearly I Have made some errors but also they seem to be allowing things they are perceiving are finished that aren't to cloud their judgement of the renovation process. I am looking for advice on how to handle clients that flip flop nonstop with their happiness and attitude towards me and my work. Also, open to constructive criticism of the entire situation. Because I feel absolutely horrible I have clients who feel so unhappy right now and I also feel like they are being a bit crazy. So please advice!I had a sort of similar issue and posted it here as well.... The consensus was to basically suck it up and finish the job. Get everything in writing and signed off. My clients were the same way until one little misunderstanding led to a snowball effect and I also received harassing calls and voicemail... Just get it done all as originally stated, shake their hand and move on.Did you fix the plumbing for free?

The only issue I can see is stopping the job for a week and a half. Even if you told the customer ebefore you started, the reality of the situation was probably a lot worse than they expected. And I'm guessing it wasn't a main focus when they hired you. Most likely went in one ear and out the other.Thanks! Our plan has Just been to hear him out and validate the concerns, and just finish the job and be done. 

We didn't fix the plumbing for free.

Although, update: the wife apologized to us today for her husband and everything he said. 

Needless to say we won't ever be working for these people again!Also, the only things left unfinished was the final coat of paint on the cabinets and touch up paint on the walls, and a few minor finishing touches. Not how we like to leave a job for any period of time, but it just was what is was. They had a fully functioning kitchen the whole time.This happens ALL the damn time. Nothing stresses people out like a renovation, and when a few things go the wrong way they focus right in on them. When you leave a job for a week and a half it just let's them sit there and stew on all the little unfinished ****.

Then things go really south when a friend or relative stops by and gets in their ear about how they should have hired so-in-so and how they over paid for x y and z. That really lights a fire under their ass, and they head straight for the keyboard to write a real nasty email.

Then when things are done and the realize how nice everything is they settle down and all is well in the world and they all live happily ever after.

The big problem is you average fat-headed nail bender will get his nose all bent out of shape when Mr. and Mrs. Smith start nit-picking him when their stress levels are at their max. 

The best thing to do is have a quiet heart-to-heart to calm them the fvck down and get the god damn job done, get paid and get the fvck out.The Following User Says Thank You to Inner10 For This Useful Post: Leo G"Didn't work through the weekend to fix it"....was it life-threatening or disruptive to the functions of the rest of the house? One has to use judgment and communicate how and when it will be handled. A bit of empathy and explanation that the repair is a priority goes a long way (and that you'll get someone on it first thing Monday, when suppliers are open).

Btw, even emergency room docs go home when their shifts are done.Really, the important thing is for you to keep being the professional. You hit your schedule, even with the sewer issue thrown in, so you had to work more to hit it.

For emergencies I'll have someone who is geared to emergency service deal with it. They usually have all the necessary parts and pieces in their truck. Non emergencies are dealt with when supply places are open.Thanks everyone for your suggestions and input! Really appreciated.Three things could have saved you some headaches...

1. If you are fabricating the cabinets, do not start the job until they are ready... almost always leads to delays for a variety of reasons (i.e. - tops, backsplash, undercab lighting, plumbing, inspections if any, etc.) and you have to reschedule everything along the way to accommodate for the domino effect of starting the job with the cabs unfinished. Add to it, finishing new cabs onsite takes much more time (costing YOU more money and loss of profit), has the potential for mishaps and any dings by the customer on the uncured finish will be expected to be fixed by the customer on your dime (and can potentially cause even more issues with a customer who is jonesing to find fault)

2. No-one begrudges someone getting married and going on their honeymoon EXCEPT right in the middle of a renovation... if you don't have the guys to run it while you're gone, you would have just been better off starting the job onsite when you returned. 

3. You should have in essence ignored the jerks BS texts on your wedding day, and just sent a reminder text along the lines of "While we always try to keep the lines of communication open with our valued customers, just a reminder, and as discussed previously, today is our wedding day with our honeymoon following, returning to your project on XX date. We will be happy to address any concerns you have at that time..."​

And then FORGET him and ENJOY your nuptials and honeymoon after giving him the courtesy of the reminder... 

Going forward with the project, and considering their apparent selective memory and previous comments, document everything, any discussions are followed up with an email or text repeating your understanding of the conversation so it eliminates any miscommunications...

Congrat's on your wedding... :thumbsup: hope it was a memorable honeymoon... :clap:ah the life of a contractor, have the client texting whatever on the day you are getting married of all things.. childbirth probably wouldn't stop their text either, I mean come on the walls need a second coat!

hard to say other than that, without seeing the job and how you communicated with them. I agree with the above that people just get stressed out during a reno. I think if you go back and make sure a nice job is done with the finishing, they will remember that more than the fact that you didn't interrupt your wedding to paint their cabinets. 

One thing I keep in mind is that five years from now, they probably won't care that you didn't drop everything to repair their sewer pipe. They will notice and remember all the small details, and if they are done well or weren't. That is the mentality I try to have, important to finish all the details and leave a nice job, IMO.He should have rescheduled the wedding and honeymoon due to the project set-backs. :tooth:MarkJames said:

If he had done that, then the customer would have said, "Oh, there's no need to do that". Sometimes you just can't win.

I would have ignores the texts and waited a few days and sent a curt to the point message about how you are enjoying your wedding and you will see them when you return.

When my kid was born I had told my customer I was taking a few days off. I was even working in their project when I got the call. I packed up, told them I would see them in a few days. The day after, I got a call wondering why I wasn't working. I went in the next day. Looking back, I should have told them to stick it and I'll see them when I see them.

It was siding, not like it really mattered if it was completed. Looking back more, I don't remember thier names or much about them. They don't matter, your wedding and new family is what matters.

https://kitchenandbath.caThe bath was framed against a deeper garage floor wall (not an outer wall) near the center of the basement. That "garage wall" is actually poured about 10 inches behind the bath/plumbed wall framing. 

It has been partly insulated with Craft paper insulation - Owens Corning R-13. Intend on putting it up on the remaining walls, ceiling and connected closet.

I don't see that a vapor barrier would give much help but on the plumbed wall, should this insulation be okay to use? Studs have all different spans. Any concern is with potential moisture coming from copper pipes.If your concern is with condensation on the pipes (as opposed to leaking :laughing, it makes all the sense in the world to have them surrounded with insulation and a vapor barrier. Insulation to help ensure that warm air doesn't get to them, and vapor barrier to hold back the extra moisture carried by warm air.

As long as you have no concerns about the pipes freezing in winter.Tinstaafl said:

Techno Metal Post - SJ Web Sitehi, everyone

this is Tim. I just start my business in residential remodeling. my first client would like to do the following stuff:

bathroom remodel: 5ft*11ft bathroom

take out the bathtub. put concrete on the ground to build a shower. replace faucet inside the shower and build a "chair" inside. add a two level shower soap dish "inside" the wall. 

replace a new toilet, install a new outlet next to the toilet, replace vanity, install a new light and a fan on top of the shower.

tile the entire bathroom, including wall, floor, total 270ft.

how much should I charge for this project? only labor, customer buy material. I am in atlanta btw.

looking forward to hear from any professional contractor. thanks so much~!!!Thank you for posting on ContractorTalk.com.

If you are a contractor seeking advice regarding your pricing structure, the Moderators of this forum would like to direct you to this thread: "Pricing, Estimating and Success".

ContractorTalk.com is designed for professional contractors to discuss issues and topics related to the construction and remodeling industries. 

We apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused. This thread has been closed.I'm finishing off a daylight basement where the 8" poured walls were covered with a 1.5" insulation mat. The homeowner pointed out a possible moisture problem on the north wall so I removed the insulation to take a look.

There were a couple of spots of obvious 'sweating' but it wasn't too serious. We figured once the wall could breathe a little it would dissipate. But now that the weather has changed (about 15 degrees F now) and the inside surface of the wall is in direct contact to the heated basement the moisture has increased significantly.

I have built a full 3 1/2" wall about an inch away from the foundation and plan to insulate it with R-15 batts.

Is there something more I should do? Throw some plastic behind the wall? Maybe some sheets of foam insulation?

I've got opinions from a damp-proofer, an inspector, an HVAC guy, other trades people. Most of them say, "Hmm. Not sure."When were the walls poured?

The damp-proofing guy says he does not like the insulation batts they glue to the walls because they don't let the walls dry out properly. But, code says you need insulation, so....

Drainage might be an issue. We are probably going to dump 5 or 6 yards of soil along that edge of the house to taper the grade away from the wall a little. Right now grade follows along the bottom of the dark spot in the photo. It's a gable end, so no roof runoff.

Adjusting the grade may help a bit, but it seem to me like the majority of the moisture is coming from just above the grade line. I don't know what you would do to fix that.Here's the outside.Agreed. How cold is it there and how damp is the basement? That could easily be condensation from the moist interior air against the cold concrete.
I assume the interior picture is the reverse of the outside image? Left is right and right is left?
Does the siding cover the concrete wall past the a/c unit?

It's been in the teens lately (fahrenheit) with windchills around zero.

Yes, the back corner of the exterior shot is the far right edge in the interior shot. Yes, the siding covers the wall on the back corner.

I think you're right about the interior air causing the condensation since that would be the spot on the wall where it's the coldest. If that's the case then maybe just building an insulated wall in front of it will solve the problem.dutchroots2 said:

Agreed, while I've seen plenty of block walls with moisture soaking through, that's unlikely with poured walls.That's condensation from warm moist air smacking into a cold wall. Foamular panels directly against the concrete wall would be my choice.

I might put 3/4" foam insulation against this wall because the cellulose matt was removed. The rest of the walls still have the matt, which I think has an R value of 6. Along with batts of R-15 in the walls, we should meet the requirements. All total, with 8" concrete wall, R6 matt, R15 batt, 1/2" drywall it should be about R23.

The rims were sprayed with foam already.I agree with above. Warm basement air coming in contact with cold concrete wall. I prefer to have 1" of foam sprayed on the walls. It will cost a little more, but by the time you figure labor, it will be close.

We frame our walls about 1/2" away from the concrete. The foam gets sprayed in after that. We also rough in electrical before foam. Makes it a little easier.

Of course you will need to let it dry before you do that. Once the moisture in the house decreases, I think you will see the wall dry out.

A little off the subject, but how about the electrical service. By the looks of your picture, it needs some attention. I'm guessing they backfilled and then ran the electrical service. When the overdig settled, it started pulling the conduit.dutchroots2 said:

That deffinately looks like water coming through the wall along the grade line.

Is the exterior of the wall waterproofed above the gradeline?

Sweating is caused by the difference in temperature outside to inside that concrete wall. since concrete is not good for insulation, convection occurs on the surface creating moisture. if the wall was sprayed with cellulose that wouldn't happen unless the waterproofing did not protrude higher than the grade-line.

if there are no problems with moisture coming through the wall, and you spray with cellulose, there will be no sweating. However this looks like an issue that should be resolved before finishing that wall.

Cutting 4" concrete slab. They're moving some rooms and freezers around. Two separate areas, about 16'x32' each, in different phases of the project.Hello, 
I am new here and new to being a GC. I've worked on a lot of remodels but am working on bidding a job that I need some advice on. My clients are wanting a full remodel of the master bedroom which is directly on the slab. The current bathroom has a corner shower insert next to a toilet with a small pedestal sink. They are wanting to tear out the shower insert and do a custom tiled shower, get rid of the pedestal and add a double sink vanity on the other side of the bathroom, and add a jacuzzi tub. My question is, before I go any further is if these things are even possible on top of a slab with in-floor heat?With enough time & a big enough check book dam near anything is possible....:thumbsup:

Based on your experience may be a good one to pass on.I could get that done! Of course it would cost a boatload.Mike.

decide right away if you need to destroy all the in floor heat or if you are just going to work around it, add in a budget for repairs, usually when we are working around the in floor heat we nick or cut the heat tube in one or two places by accident.

Some heat tube is easy to repair and get parts for. Some heat tube is obsolete and garbage with no easy way to repair so be prepared and know what your up against.Make sure the slab is NOT post tension! :no:It's easy to have a business that is busy.. it's harder to have a business that makes a profitAbandon the in floor heat, install a new heat mat under the new tile.

Nothing wrong with upgrading windows as they will make a huge difference. So will sealing the top plates to drywall. Sealing up all electrical outlets, light switches, etc. Upgrading insulation. A thermal scan and pressure test would be revealing.Personally I think if you are replacing good sealing to energy ones think you are going to be a little disappointed. The ads of saving up to 30% on heating bill by replacing them is a lot of sales talk. I have always be told windows are a very slow pay back item. By the way some one show me real proof I will change my thinking. When I sell windows I sell the need of replacement, poor sealing, rotting out , things like that. Not that they are going to save them a bunch of money.Randy Bush said:

Some years back I worked for a GC who did a lot of Lowe's work, so I got quite a bit of experience at replacing windows & doors. Often that was a foot in the door (so to speak) for other work, so I had a chance to hear feedback after the windows were in for a season or two.

I got the comment that the new windows didn't make a lot of difference much more often than that they did.Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkMordekyle said:

More truth then fiction in that one. Lol

Sent from my LG-V410 using TapatalkI always tell people to not expect a difference in their utility bill. There will be some, but probably not enough to notice. 

What I do tell them is to expect the window to seal up good and stop drafts, work properly, and it will make the house quieter. 

Replacement windows are more about quality of life and not a big money saver. 

I don't think you will see a difference in your bill using standard double pane, so you can imagine what I think about triple pane.

The disadvantage that most of them mentioned is the only the initial cost involved in installing the windows. Before we proceed ahead and install them, is there anything more we should know about windows? And how about triple glazed windows? Does it cost even more?

Here in FL they got a/c systems that pay for them selves :whistlingStill "Shakin" the tree bossI had one customer that kept track of fuel after the project. We installed replacements on the entire house. We stripped the siding, added 1/2" fan fold and vinyl. Taped and foamed everything and did a tight job. 

His average the 5 years prior was between $2,400 to $2,800 for a season of oil. The first winter after the project was $1,800 and it was a warm winter. For the 30k project it will never pay for itself and I tell people this.

They couldn't be happier, the curb appeal is night and day, much less drafty in the winter. They have been there 20 years and enjoy the renovation. I would never sell a window or door as something that will pay for itself.I think a lot of it has to do with the house you are starting with. A small millhouse will react very well to fanfold, properly installed vinyl windows and vinyl siding.

A more open rambling house like we live in, with a myriad of drafts, attic spaces, open crawlspaces, etc. will be different. There a lot of things that need done instead of just windows.

I have done houses where the people immediately felt the house tighten up and stay warmer as we did each room. I think a lot of it has to do with stopping the drafts, so it feels a lot cozier. Whether it really helps a lot with heating bills, maybe maybe not. But yeah, to save 300 a year after a 25,000 dollar exterior remodel, nope. Won't ever really pay off. Especially if the power company keeps raising rates. Though, just feeling more comfortable, is usually worth it.Low E vs single pane. I'd go low E Everytime. There is a difference in these two types. But the wow factor will not show if your home is not up to par with insulation. If your walls are rated @ R-15 or below forget replacements unless there is a call for it.There's very little cost savings using energy efficient windows. Most of the heating and cooling energy required is affected by how effective your wall insulation is. I don't really think it's worth the investment.lge77 said:

Depending on the build of the house, I would probably put air sealing ahead of and above insulation for improved comfort and energy savings.In particular, on a hip roof. Two levels and tapes? Digital level?

This would be to give a number to the truss plant to match. I feel like I need to measure a long section to get a good number.

My concern is the venting. There is a finished room with 2 knee walls on both sides. There are 2 gable vents and a continuous ridge vent. Is that sufficient? The house only has soffit on one side only which is currently not vented.. What are my options in terms of properly venting this house? This has left me stumped! Thank you in advance!IRC says that if you have 40-50% of your venting in the upper portion of the roof (i.e no more than 3' below the ridge), you can have a ratio of 1:300. That is 1 sqft of ventilation for every 300sqft of attic floor.

In all other situations, the minimum is 1:150.

In my understanding of the rule of thumb, if the pitch is greater than 6:12 you need to up the ventilation by 20%. I'm not a roofer by any means and maybe one of them can chime in. But this is my understanding of building code.

Code minimum is 1 SF of Net Free Area for every 150 SF of attic
floor space. Attic sq. ft. ÷ 2 = sq. in. of intake NFA and exhaust NFA needed @ 1/150 ratio.
Use shortcut formula lets say you have 1,000 SQFT Attic space ÷ 2 = you need 500SQIN of intake and 500SQIN of exhaust. 
Doing it this way it comes out a little more which is fine... to get more accurate calculation you have to do more math, not many do that unless you have to be on the dime.I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​Exactly. The shortcut puts you very close to the needed amount. Excuse my lack of verbiage in my original post. NFA is the correct term, not ventilation.CharlieDelta said:

I can't say I would be surprised. Besides, any NFA item is way cooler than attic ventilation lol.You have to many venting systems at work here. You're best to use the ridge venting, and to add soffit vent, making sure there's air space so ridge vent can pull from soffit vents. cover those gable vents. More than one venting system isn't better when it comes to ventilation, a properly install ONE is.

Robert Beyette. "Focus on Profits"
Beyette Roofing,Inc.ConcurWe demoed a parquet floor that was glued down (approx. 420 SF). The subfloor was badly damaged in the process. 





The new floor will have a ceramic tile (large format) picture frame border around the perimeter of the room and the center will ¾” white oak strip flooring. I’m not too concerned with the areas where the tile goes. It will be built-up (including Ditra XL). But, I’m struggling with what to do with the area covered by the wood floor.

My first thought was to find a wood filler that could be troweled on or some sort of self-leveling product. I’m not finding a product that fits the bill. My second thought is to glue down a ¼” ply to the subfloor. This would be ok, with the exception of transitions to the two adjoining room floors – the existing flooring is tile (probably 5/8” to ¾” thick).

Any other ideas?I love what I do and I'm very good at it!

Da Vinci on the web or Da Vinci On FacebookThat sucks. I'd rip up the subfloor and redo it. It's compromised. I understand if budget doesn't allow for that thoughGrind with 16 grit buffer. Then 1/2 x 1/2 notched trowel thinset under hardi backer. Then set tile with a leveling system.

The whole reason for mud under the backer board is to fill voids and irregularities. That floor would be stiff.

My only approach would be to breakout the circular saw and start prying the sheets out. The subfloor as it is right now in these pictures is already too compromised, regardless of what you lay over it.

Inside edge of one joist, outside edge of next joist. Piece pries up, leverage allows you to roll it off the second joist. I find it easier than cutting between 2 joists, then having to remove the strip from each joist.

Da Vinci on the web or Da Vinci On FacebookI got this job repairing cracks in a living room walls and ceiling, texturing it all, installing crown, painting etc. I told the lady Saturday I would call her monday evening after painting this swimming pool. She sent this email this morning - 

"Chip,

What if I help you? That will get project started and help with costs."

I know she is energetic and outgoing and all but I really do not want her to help but I don't want to hurt her feelings. I definitely do not want to fix mudwork done wrong 

I told her already that clearing out the room of furniture, pictures etc would be great help. Has anyone else had this come up?..

I've cut this board three times and it's still too short!"sorry, my insurance agent would go through the roof if he heard you were helping me. I'm not allowed to have any helpers on my job unless are fully insured."


Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkSay something like this:

The price I gave you was for me to do the work. While I understand your reasoning for wanting to help, I have my systems and procedures set up to operate efficiently and when introducing someone to my processes who doesn't have proficiency with the way I do things, it ends up taking longer than it would for me to have done it myself. Having said that, if you'd still like to help, here is the (much higher) revised price. How would you like to proceed?I think telling her moving furniture etc was a good move, gets her involved, and it's stuff you would hope they would do before you show up.

As for her helping out with the work: I agree with you, I wouldn't want a homeowner doing the work along with me.

I would do what is suggested above and go with the insurance line, as well as a line going into detail that while you understand she wants to help, you have your methods to get a proper job done, and have learned this from years of experience with the work. This is what you rely on for a quality finish, and someone else performing what is supposed to be your scope of work, would result in an inability to offer a warranty for the work, as well as for the original price to be honored if there is any deficiency work to be done resulting from homeowner's work.

IE if you have HO doing a bunch of sanding, then you prime and a bunch of areas were missed, will she be fine paying you for another skimcoat of mud to fix her mistakes? or will she be fine and say leave it? but if you are like me that would drive you nuts, and the work would have your name on it whether she helped or not, so anyone coming over and seeing the work, if her part isn't that great, will reflect badly on you. those would be my thoughts in that situation.

For me it is typically the homeowner just want to stand two feet away and watch sometimes. I can't stand that, but am polite and make conversation. Typically older retired fellows bored out of their minds I think. Pleasant enough guys, but makes for a long day.I worry about paid help, I'll be damned if I let a client help.Workingmanvan said:

I've cut this board three times and it's still too short!Reminds me of a job I did years ago.. customer (family friend) was doing a bunch of remodeling to a house he bought and was moving into. He hired myself to do a large portion of the work. Charged him an hourly rate, was a good few weeks work.

One morning upon arrival, I was quite surprised at the scene in one of the bathrooms. I guess he had figured he'd get ahead of the game and take care of some of the painting himself. There was a roller cage on the floor with a sleeve, dried up with paint. One of those gimmicky edger things marketed to homeowners for a perfect cut in line, also laying on the floor. The absolute worst wall cut ins I've ever seen, all over the ceiling (which was already finished, painted a bright white), as well as the worst rolling work I've ever seen, drips everywhere, not even finished in a 5x8 bathroom with no fixtures in yet. A couple empty beer bottles on the floor.

He never mentioned it once. Took me twice as long to fix his work and redo the painting, as it would have just for me to paint it to begin with. He never attempted anymore "help" after that one. Which was a relief.Chipfo said:

Try a 24" bar. Find your studs. Use long stainless screws, and angle the bar to get stud support on both ends. As for setting the height, approximate the height of your customer, crouch down the the same standing height, and reach out and touch the wall. That's where the bar should go.

If there's a wide wall gap, access it and fill it with a wide piece of plywood, then put the bar wherever you want (secure to plywood).Sometimes you can drill a hole and squeeze grout in with the tub surround in place. Extra long screws, put them in before the grout sets and wax them so they don't stick to the grout. Retighten after the grout cures.There are hollow wall anchors just for that application, they bridge the gap between the fibreglass and the drywall. I can't remember the name off the top of my head, but I bet you could google it. 
If the backside is a closet or something, it may be easy enough to cut out a section and put in some blocking.

Click to expand...I install a lot of these in senior homes. Wingits are great. Moen's are nice too but at 20 bucks a pop it gets pricey. I let the HO decide. Wingits need a 3/4"hole and the Moens I think an even larger hole. But they both withhold a boatload of foot pounds. 

It the OP's situation I dont mess around. If I can't catch studs and secure it down with some beefy stainless steel screws, I'm opening up the backside of the wall and screwing in some real support. I don't want a 250 guy or gal grabbing on it and having it pull out.Wingits are unbelieveably solid and strong. They hold up in a highschool your pretty much good to go anywhere else. Dont let the hole scare you.

their downside is minimum 5/8" wall thickness.

The Moens work very well also. I installed them in my own house with no issues.Client wants to avoid permit for obvious reasons. Says he was told that you do NOT need a permit to fur out a wall, use foam insulation and install drywall over it. IF this is true, I would drylock the walls, possibly install a vapor barrier, use plastic/composite furring strips, pink foam and mold/moisture resistant drywall. Build a couple closets (no permit needed) put in some electrical outlets - permit needed, etc. 

Any thoughts on the need for a permit to fur out cement foundation walls?Varies by state, county, town city. Where are you?

That would be true.:laughing:


OP, if you finish the basement and then try to sell the house and your township does inspections for real estate sales, they will make you tear down the drywall to inspect the framing.
Also, no electrical inspector will come and inspect the electrical and see all the framing and not alert the building inspector to what you did.Trump-The "Con Man's" Con Man.TimNJ said:

I've heard rumors of that happening for interior work, but that's it. No solid stories. 

One of our neighbors was forced to remove a nice attached carport due to non-permit and setback issues (and having a neighbor from he77), but that's the only one I can think of.IMO any GC should know.. or easily know where to acquire such simple information. You are thinking of doing the work by going by what he says ???

SMH.

Find out if one is needed in that county ? AND GET A PERMIT !! 

I've seen homeowners and contractors get busted for trying to cut corners. I've seen inspectors make them re-do entire roof projects, tear out walls to inspect things, dig into the ground to check depth of deck posts, etc etc. And yeah when you go to sell the place your short-cuts come back to bite you in the rectum.

Electrical ContractorTown next to me if you have a finished basement without permits, they make you cut walls 10'OC and install vertical fire stopping. Firestop the tops between the plate and sill plate, they check drop ceiling to make sure the right gauge wire is used :laughing: Bring all electric to code, etc.
If the basement has a bathroom, they want the vent out the roof, they want a video scan of the pipes under the slab and have a report from the company doing the work.

I hope you not in this town :laughing: in any case, your HO doesn't know what they talking about and being a GC you should know better... not to mention all you have to do is call the town, why you wasting time in here.I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​Been a good while since I've been on here and forgot all my credentials so I just started from scratch. I'm going to rebuild a deck which is about 10' high, saving the roof which is 17' from the concrete patio below the deck. I'm going to demo the deck, then replace the 3 posts one at a time. Currently they're 6x6s up to the deck, then 4x4s from the deck to the roof. I'm going with 6x6s all the way up. 
The question: does anyone have a method for erecting by hand 17' pressure treated 6x6s atop a concrete pad with no holes to drop them into? There is no access for equipment.

That's exactly what I was thinking, using 4 2x8x10s nailed together (two 10' & two 7') with staggered joints for a temp support.We've been on a whole house remodel through the winter. Inside and out. It's been a great job that got us solid through the winter, but I have let her get away with way too many small extras. 

It's my fault. I know. My bids on these bigger remodels will go much more into detail in the future.

We are on the punch list now, but I haven't made a dime in the last few weeks. 

Homeowner starts looking at the bottom of the kitchen cabinets and thinks they need painted so I told her to grab a brush. She laughed it off and says she's not a good painter. I politely told her I'd be glad to put a bid on it. She left me alone.

I think I got my point across.I do freebies for nice clients all the time. However the very first time they request or ask that I do something free of charge, they get cut off immediately.

My advice is to just keep one piece of paper in their file and document every single extra they got without charge on a project and what it would have cost them. I do it on nearly every project and I've only had to "whip it out" once.:laughing:220...221...whatever it takes!I do a lot of little freebies too. Most of the time I write it off as something I should have noticed when I estimated, and I can make it up on another portion of the job.

This one has gotten out of hand. I've been doing this long enough to make a name for myself and have no trouble finding work. It's time to do more than just pay the bills.her: Hey, you didn't put a price on knocking out a knockout and putting the washing machine hose down it.

Me: No worries, I got it.

Later....

Me: Hey, you want me to replace those three pipe jacks on the roof?

Her: I was going to have somebody else do it, but they never got back to me. Sure go ahead.

So I send an invoice.

Her: Ack! Somebody else priced those for $40 apiece. Can you do that.

Me: Sure. 


So, I just met a price of a (probably Craigslist flake) who didn't even get a hold of my customer. AFTER throwing in a freebie.

Fool me once,.....

He walked into the house with his hard money lender for a final walk through so he could get his money draw for being market ready. He started going off on me about the floors after the lender questioned him as to why the floors were not refinished. I reminded him that the floors were suggested to him prior to the beginning of the work, and that he stated that he would only refinish them if it became a deal breaker for a potential buyer. He went "dirty" right there on the spot and tried to say that we never spoke about the floors, and that I created damage to the hardwood during my work even though I had every square inch of the floors covered with red rosin.

I went out to the truck and got the signed scope of work that included the protection of hardwood with red rosin. I then told him to open up our messages on his cell phone back to where I had suggested the floors twice.

I got my check 2 days later and blocked Mr. Dirty on cell phone.

His lender called me last week and said that he liked the work I did on the place and asked if he could drop my name to a few of his borrowers that who were really good people, but desperately needing a "go to" guy. 

I am meeting with one of them tomorrow.I get asked to do alot of extras, while I'm there. I almost always add on for them. Never had a problem collecting. I do my fair share of freebees, but not more than my fair share.

Duely noted.your not her friend or spouse or relative

you make your money by any physical activity you do for a person

she sounds like a sexist , and you sound like your trying to be this nice "guy" wanting to help to a woman.

my last line in the proposal usually doesn`t say " total job cost " anymore.

it says " cost for above mentioned items spelled out " and have my total here 

I make sure and ad
" if we have missed any items we will charge accordingly , and won`t proceed until both parties agree .

" all extra work will be performed at ( your hourly rate here )$ per hour

if your doing a remodel with phases , you should bill her per phase , and also her inspect , and sign off on those items .

of course you do extras :
we all do
but its like the one guy on here said " for nice people "
and even then there is always a limit .

just learn to say " I have to charge you for that "
when they ask for a favor 
again :
your not their friend , or relative 
they true only reason you are there, is for money.

you work on return or referral business .

your way of doing business , you won`t want to come back to this lady because you didn`t make money.
then collaterally , they won`t refer you eitherDishonest house flippers are the worst in my honest opinion.John1957 said:

BAMM!...  :thumbup: :clap:We are remodeling some offices and the smallest office has an exterior steel door that gets hot enough when the sun is on it that it overpowers the air conditioning and warms up the room pretty good. I haven't checked if the door is insulated yet but if it isn't, would changing it out be sufficient enough to stop the blistering heat? They talked about insulating and blocking it but I think the fire marshal would have a problem with that. They never use the door.

If that door's required by code, the fire marshal would have a problem with that bookcase. Tread carefully.

It's probably required to be steel, in which case there'd be little gain by switching it out, insulation or not. Any chance of building something outside to shade it from the sun?Tinstaafl said:

so long as you do not impede egress its ok. Exit hardware must remain uncovered and fully operational as intended.

If it is a heavy steel commercial grade door it is probably hollow and that is why the heat transfer.

The opening is finished with dry wall and bullnose corners. He doesn't want the drywall disturbed. I told him I would look into it. 
my thoughts are If I found a door that was smaller than the sheetrocked opening I could shim it plumb and trim it. I would remove enough of the sheetrock behind the jamb for good attachment to the framing. 

Do you guys have any thought on this?
Thanks, FredWhat size is the framing of the wall? 2 x 6 or bigger?

Ditto..... but if all is good should work fineI would think."Whether you think you can or think you can't.... you are right!!!" Henry Ford :thumbsup:​Thanks for the replies fellas. I went out and looked at it today and the opening was a 2*4 jamb. He told me we were looking at a 2*6 wall. So I will very carefully cut out the bullnose, on both sides, with my multi tool. Might be a good idea to scour a cut line with the knife first. 

Bullnose is on both sides so this will be the time consuming part. If it was a 2*6 wall I could have saved the bullnose on one side of the opening turning it into a small Jamb extension going into a 4.5" Jamb door. 

Anyway, Thank for the help fellas, Next time I'll look at the job before I jump on the computer:whistlingI should have told you the door trim in the house is 4" stained pine, so I'm not too worried about cutting out the bullnoseSome time ago a pipe leaked in an old building.

Years later, I was called in to paint the acoustic ceiling below it.

With this roughly 5" of rust on the metal frame, I am trying to figure if a replacement could be spliced in - the rust picking its' spot near the center of the ceiling, by a light fixture, on about a 12 x 12 T Bar. Are the metal typically continuous runs from one side to the next?

Maybe rivet one back in? Where do you find old sections of T bar? Maybe hire a metal shop to make one (have no metal benders, or one strong enough... ? The rust does seem more than surface deep or I'd sand, red-primer and paint...

Unfortunately I don't have access to snap pics to post or I would. No have I pushed up a tile to view the support wires ...

Anyone run into this before?

Only other idea I've had is using a rust converter...T-Bar ceilings are put in in a grid fashion. There are long runners and the short pieces that snap in between them.

There are several manufacturers of T-Bar components none of which are obvious to me but an Acoustical Ceiling guy sees them right away.

Parts are generally available at lumber yards, hardware stores etc. 

There are also tie wires, to the ceiling and likely thrust posts all attached to the long runners.

Now as far as matching what you have and color......I am preparing a bid for a longtime customer. He has an 18×18 screened in porch that he would like finished into a studio. Everything is straightforward and I've done similar projects many times. The problem is it sits about 6" above grade at one end and 16" at the other. It's on 2x10 joists so I can pull up the decking and insulate with R30 from above. But what should I place under the joists to protect the insulation from moisture, vermin, etc.? 

The answer may be to excavate. But I'm hoping for an easier alternative? Is there any kind of metal decking that can be attached from above, after being a slid under and into place?could you use an exterior grade plywood and A35s or something similiar? you could probably even paint the ply firstThat's a great idea! Easy enough to lay them out and fasten the A35s before sliding them under.We are adding a room & bathroom to the rear of a house. In the middle of where we tied into the existing house is the back & sides of the brick fireplace/chimney...which now is enclosed under the new roof. We plan on sheet-rocking around the brick fireplace/chimney. Can the framing butt right up against the brick or is a 2" gap required between the framing & brick?Looks like you're asking the question a little late in the game.

Wade through this: http://www.rumford.com/code/clearances.htmlYou need a space all around. Can't remember if it's 1" or 2". And from the pics it looks like you have to go backwards for a bit first. That roof framed tight too?As of now, the IRC... it's 2" airspace from framing and combustibles...it's a slightly excessive code but it is what it is. It's consistently violated however once the insulations guys, trims guys and siders routinely slam combustible products right up to them. 

I believe the IBC has now recognized 12" of masonry and you're good to go, IRC is pushing for change as well 

That said, if have 8" solid masonry from the flue itself, it wouldn't be a problem IMO but an inspector should rightfully tag it under the current code and more than likely will."Under promise, over deliver and all that!" JBM

I am curious if anyone can think of cheap methods around this that are still nice and last. It is bare bones down there, brick walls and cement floor.

If you figure out how to finish a basement for 6k you can come do mine. If I do it myself it will cost twice that. Let me know hoe your schedule is looking.No cheap way to do a basement and have it look nice and last. I would suggest that they maybe to it in stages. Do the egress windows , insulate and fir walls out , electrical work, drywall, then flooring last. Do it right the first time so not wasting money redoing things later on because things where done cheap. Helping him out as a friend is all well and fine,but you still need to make a living too. I guy can only afford so many friend to help out when in business.The lowest I have seen done for a complete finish is around $16 k and that was for a small area. If you are taking bare minimal living you can probably get away with half but you have to buy wholesale and do the labor yourself.AC Man Houston

Sometimes I wonder if we're being punked by some of the questions around here.Have them do the work themselves and buy what they need on a rolling basis as they can afford it.

As others have said define livable, paint everything up nice install lights and outlets and throw down some area rugs you can live in that won't be the nicest but it is livable.

Egress, Drop ceiling, wall to divide the space up, and doors. No flooring or "prettying up" the outer brick walls. Just going to paint them. That is where I got the number. This is the cheaper end of it, I am aware.Perkins Preferred Roofing and Construction

IDK... Craigslist for materials?How many sf you talking about? 

Build one wall interior wall, How long and how tall ? Frame it, anchor it, hang and finish drywall then paint. How long you figure that will take you? 

Drywalling all the cement walls? You'll need fur strips or framing to hang the sheetrock, then tape, mud and finish that too. Paint. 

Any electrical additions ? if yes, add in more materials and labor. Hiring an electrician or are you planning to do it yourself and take on the liability issue ?

Inspections/Permits ? You can have the owner pull them. Or not. eek. 

Have you ever put in a drop ceiling before ? if not if may consume more time than you think ? 

I don't think $6k is even close. The only way I'd consider doing something like that is if I were a greenhorn, didn't know what I was doing and wanted to learn/experiment. This way you gain some knowledge and skill and maybe make a little profit off it. OTOH I have seen some butcher-workers come in and bang out a fast and crappy job and make a profit. And beleive it or not sometimes the homeowners love it. I just shake my head when that happens.MarkJames said:

Unless this is a best friend that you plan to help for the ole pizza and beer special, this job is one to run from. The only way to do anything for this "friend of a friend" is let them know it can't be done on a 6K budget.For the record, seven years ago, I finished my 400 square foot basement.

I spent 350 on having the sheet rock hung, spent 350 on an under the table electrician to wire cans. 

I framed the walls for electrical and rock. I taped and textured the rock, painted walls, painted concrete floors. Installed two kitchen cabinets and laminate top. Installed basemolding and a new door. And bought the cheapest fridge and oven money could buy. Total cost 5k. Not including any value for the 120 hours I spent working on it.

Sent from my SM-N910T using TapatalkDrylock and old curtainsI'm all for freedom of speech but Irish is costing lives on this threadI was contemplating adding water, mold, fire and smoke remediation to my current business. I would like to hear comments on anyone that has received it and from what organization. I am looking for a valued learning experience as opposed to a power point and print your certification at the end. I appreciate all input.I don't know what you are expecting other than the certification. There is no rocket science to water & mold recovery. You can learn just as much by Googling than sitting in some class. But most areas require a certification.

It always comes down to:

Personal protection... don't believe for a minute that the standard 3M N-95 mask will do in all cases. The 3M 6000 & 7000 half face respirators are about the best going.

Removing the wet and damaged content.

Dehumidifying......high capacity dehumidifiers are essential, and especially when it's raining outside for days at a time while you go through the process.. 

Strategic placement of fans for drying out.....walls, ceilings, closets, cabinets, electrical outlets, and crawl spaces.

Metering relative air humidity and moisture content of walls-ceilings-studs -joists etc. etc. I log this every 4 hours during the day time.

I go the extra step of spraying encapsulating Concrobium after the studs and joists dry. 

Providing documentation of moisture content prior to rehab to the home owner, association, insurance company, and local gov't in some cases.

I have assisted with, or supervised about 20 flood damage and mold remediation jobs. It's pretty basic stuff really. About the only technical aspects that I have run into are usually involved with condo units if I am doing the repairs. There are some UL Codes that are specific to drywall and hat channel for sound and fire depending on age of the unit and local codes..If you're looking to get paid by an insurance company for the actual mitigation then you'd better be certified and insured appropriately. Using Xactimate is also a major factor unless you're willing to let the adjusters walk all over you.

My company uses IICRC training and certification, which seems to be the most popular on the east coast, but I've heard that other organisations are better on the west coast.

Mold and smoke are a whole lot harder than water, in most cases. Water is usually pretty much demo, dry, rebuild. Don't make the mistake of thinking that the insurance companies are just laying around waiting for you to start helping them out. The franchises spend HUGE money marketing and have dedicated salespeople(like me) out talking to those agents all day, every day. It's nothing like construction on that end.Jaws;1780140 said:



Planer.....

Click to expand...As a member of this industry there is so much more that goes into it than just learning what they teach in the courses. For one, half this business is still conducted on the golf course. 

Two, homeowners contents are a huge part of this industry that takes immense manpower and storage facilities. God I hate contents. 

Three, field experience is the only teacher when it comes to profitable mold (asbestos) abatement. 

***Four, as a carpenter in this field...There is a big difference between giving somebody something brand new (renovations) and trying to redo it "exactly" as it was. Homeowners notice way more when things are supposed to be put back the way they were. Something they didn't notice for 15 years is suddenly your problem. If you use sub trades a punch list carpenter can keep himself busy 6 days a week. 

Five, prices are driven down because the ins companies set the prices for many items in xactimate and alot of them are unrealistic. Almost everything and I mean everything is line item pricing. Room by room piece by piece. 

Six, homeowner holds your check until they are "satisfied". You would be amazed how many things they require to be satisfied when it's not their coin. Reference reason four. Their satisfaction is very important to there insurance company continuing business. Second only to reason five but not really second more like tied. No ins company wants to lose premiums after forking over a lump sum.

I think I could go on for days of the complications that arise specifically in this industry. 

Oh and when it comes to smoke and fire..... Don't touch it without someone who has done a hundred of them. No book can teach where smoke goes. It's like pressurized water that has no gravity. 

In conclusion I would say that unless you plan on stealing a very good insurance loss estimator, insurance adjuster specific salesman with a sub 5 golf handicap and some really experienced technicians in the field this industry can get incredibly tricky. Also carpenters are not technicians. See what happens when you tell your carpenter to scrape stuck on corn, poop, and toilet paper from a floor. 

We have a saying, it's not construction it's restoration. The two are not at the same table. 







Sent from my SM-G903W using TapatalkI spent over 10 years in that business and don't miss most of it for a minute!! The money can be good but be ready to work 24/7. You need an on call team to respond to losses right away, and not leave until it is drying/boarded up depending on what you are dealing with. Like someone else mentioned something they didn't have a problem with is now your problem. You are supposed to restore to "preloss condition" but that is never what it is. One of the biggest things to remember is when you do a remodel people are planning on that remodel for months if not years, that is not the case for restoration work. These people just rushed from their home as it was burning, or are in full panic mode due to a flooded basement or bathroom. It is a very tough business but there is money to be made, also be ready for burn out. Everyone eventually has enough of on call schedules. Then you have to deal with new losses while also dealing with the current rebuilds which can be extremely hard for a small company. If you take it on I wish you luck and do not just search the internet, take classes, become certified and pay for xactimate.Hello,

I'm going to replace some old cabinets with IKEA cabinets but need to keep the granite counter top. The counter top is 100" long and 3/4" thick with double thick front edge, back trim and under mount sink. I am thinking of the way to deal with the counter top.

1. Keep the counter top in place and replace the cabinets one by one. The IKEA cabinet legs can be adjusted in 1" height. One people do the job.

2. Slide out the counter top to some saw horses (same height with the old cabinets) and than push it back. Not sure how many people can do the job.

3. Move the counter top and sink to somewhere and reinstall. Not sure if 2 people are enough.

Could anyone give me some suggestion/comment? Really appreciate.Ikea cabinets would be a non-starter for a granite counter top.Like driving nitro down a bumpy road... :no:It's easy to have a business that is busy.. it's harder to have a business that makes a profitAre IKEA cabinets strong enough to hold the top up?

While definitely a contrast in quality of materials, in addition to being attached to the walls, when cabinets are attached to one another as would be the case with the IKEA cabs, they create up to a 1 1/2" support structure on the sides from cab to cab in the field that holds the most weight... most FF cabinets are 3/8" - 3/4" sides with a 1.5 - 2" FF... 

Not something I would use with granite, but it has more to do with contrast in the quality of the materials than weight concerns... the two together makes you ask "what happened? you run out of money?"...htang said:

Sure, I know the company that fabricates and installs tops for them in the NY area. They just have to be assembled and installed correctly, this company does tons of them. If the cabinets are incorrectly installed they don't put the top on and HO gets charged a service call of $250 I think.

Many people are unfamiliar with European cabinets which is where the problems start.KAP said:

Again, not something I'd use with granite... but not because of weight issues... the way I see it, you're saving money (assuming you can pull it off) by re-using the granite top; spend a little more on a quality cab... especially if you plan on selling within the next 5-7 years or if this is "home" and it's your last kitchen...mstrat said:

That's a big surprise. Originally, I wanted to know the best way to reuse the counter top but now I got a bigger concern. IKEA sells quartz counter top that could be installed on their cabinets. How does that happen? I have never doubt a row of IKEA cabinets can't support a 200 pound stone until now.htang said:

Keep in mind that some of these guys have probably tried climbing on top of those cabinets... and, oh well.

Kidding aside, probably the best route to go would be to have a countertop outfit remove it, install the cabinets, and have them replace it. They have the equipment and experience with handling slabs like that. If you mis-handle it, you'll be buying a new one.rrk said:

You are right. I haven't installed very many European cabinets. Then again, I don't think IKEA are European cabinets. I think they are European design. They may have been made in Sweden at one time.

I have no idea where they are made. Just because they are a European design, doesn't mean they are strong enough to hold up a granite countertop. 
But, like you said, there is a company in New York that does it all the time, so it must be fine. I'm sure no one would install a top on weak cabinets and then when the cabinets fall apart say, it's not the top, it's your cabinets. I'm sure there also isn't a clause in their contract that says not responsible for the cabinets.

I have put in a few IKEA cabinets, that homeowners bought. I wasn't impressed. That's me though. I'm probably a cabinet snob.

As to your question, I would hire a granite company to come out, remove the top and then pay them to replace the top. They have the tools and experience.Frameless cabinets have been around for awhile, most of them do have the adjustable legs. The sides are doweled into the bottom. The biggest issue with IKEA cabinets is racking not if it will hold the weight, if the cabinets are not assembled correctly they wobble side to side. While I do not install many IKEA cabinets now I have used cabinets from here .

http://cabparts.com/products-cabinetboxes.html

in offices and medical buildings.
And I always use the adjustable feet

My biggest issue with IKEA is the hardware, the hinges and slides do not last long under heavy usesome of the ikea cabinets only have very light gauge metal straps that act as stretchers at the top so your relying solely on a bottom, two sides and a pc of 1/8" hardboard for the back... combine the cheap plastic legs that have already mentioned .... have fun replacing your cabinets a week later when they collapse under the weight of the granite or the granite cracks because it sagsputting down subfloor with glue and screws, well i saw dr. smith and the robot too , i had a martian burger and a sonic shakeGetting ready to start this remodel adding an open gable (no ceiling) porch roof and remove carport and add garage. Customer wants an Open Gable Porch roof. My question concerns the open ceiling/gable porch. It will be 20' wide and 6' out from house. 

What's best way to sheet roof to avoid roofing nails protruding/visible? How do you deal with the collar ties being exposed? We are on the coast in NC so all framing fasteners and rafter ties will be 316 Stainless exposed. 

I attached one pic of house front and one pic of the porch roof they want. Appreciate any ideas you folks may have. Thanks.Shouldn't need any collar ties for that if you support your ridge board as a beam. Besides that, Your left and right beams will both be tied together at the front and back on a 6 ft span. No collar ties.

As far as the underside of the roof goes, I would put some 1x2 on either side of the rafters tight against the sheathing and put some bead board or lap board underneath between the rafters.Lay sleepers over T&G then sheathe. Create a vent.
Or 5/4 T&G, or sheathe as normal the install cleats in-between rafters to attach finished ceiling material.

Just a few thoughtsJust a note- 20' wide seems a little overbearing for house that size.... but it's not my house.IMO an open gable porch on that house will not look near as good as the one in the pic. The house you will be working on has to low a slope roof IMO to attempt that look. 

Talk them into popping the top on the whole house and putting a steeper roof on that bad boy. It will look way better. 


Oh and best way to sheet the roof with no nails showing is to not miss the rafters when you nail it. Lol

Thanks Shullcon, After reviewing the code again I believe you may be correct on no need for collar ties. Putting the bead board or ship lar in between the rafters is also a viable option which I had considered. If I did that I would probably go with larger rafter material, 2x8 or 2x10 so we still have sufficient rafter showing...Thanks.Tom M said:

Thanks NJ, I agree regarding the low pitch...however, you know how it is when your customer has been looking at open gables on Pinetrest for years dreaming of this. There is nothing I could say to convince "her" of other options. I did convince her to let me increase the pitch on the new porch roof to maximum without exceeding existing ridge line. Existing is 4/12, I think I can get a 7 or 8/12 up there. Plus adding on 20' closed in garage on left end will help balance it out.

Here the nails only have to penetrate if sheathing is less than 3/4". 

"R905.2.5 Fasteners. Fasteners for asphalt shingles shall be
galvanized steel, stainless steel, aluminum or copper roofing
nails, minimum 12 gage [0.105 inch (3 mm)] shank with a
minimum 3/8-inch (10 mm) diameter head, ASTM F 1667, of
a length to penetrate through the roofing materials and a minimum of
3/4-inch (19 mm) into the roof sheathing. Where the
roof sheathing is less than 3/4-inch (19 mm) thick, the fasteners
shall penetrate through the sheathing." 

That said, using a 1" nail with architectural shingle and underlayment would be really close.

Man I suck at Sketchup. I Maybe I'll try it again. And you're right about the Dream vs Nightmare and I wouldn't want my name on a nightmare!And DANG! I just pulled the parcel card and the house was built in 1960. You all know what that means? Pre-1978...That's right RRP.

 Oh Heck no...I ain't doing that. I have seen that on the same street and worse.
I'll post pics when done and I hope nobody says it looks like dog do-do.

This pic is the first preliminary sketch I gave them for the project.Looks perfect for that house CanmanncYou read that right. 1/2" thick. Under contract to remodel a basement, was going to grind floor for a salt and pepper finish, but discovered it's basically nothing. Thickest portions range up to 2" thick, but most are less. Easy to smash any portion with one swing of the sledge from my hefty 160 pound frame.

Funny thing is it's the second house on the same street where I found this. 1920s homes. Now worth $700-1mil.

Anyone ever encountered one so thin? 

Anyway, looks like this week we're setting up the conveyor, busting up a slab, digging down, and pouring new. Yehaw!You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.sounds like a rat slab.Found the same thing a few weeks ago in a portion of the basement of a 1920's multifamily rental I own, while trying to remodel the laundry room. 

We did what you are about to do - removed the slab and poured a new one with gravel and all...good times. We were able to shoot the concrete through a window. It's never easy.Well, at least the demo should be relatively easy.

I've seen a couple like that, but not common at all.Hauling materials in a wagon and mixing by hand, I bet it would be easy to convince yourself a 1/2" was plenty good enough:whistlingI can't compete with hacks.Never 1/2". But definitely 1-2" yes. Did a slab last fall that we dug up and did gravel, foam, poly.

Yes, 1 1/2" was always the usual norm for a rat slab. In the earlier days, the guys would use a 2x on the flat and bring concrete to it, I saw them do that mostly in crawl spaces, but in 1900's they did the basements with a rat slab.I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​Usually when redoing slabs there is also concern for ceilings my height and when you add in foam and wire in the concrete you end up having to go downI never seen specs. that didn't require a rat slab in a crawl..."Under promise, over deliver and all that!"

You read that right. 1/2" thick. Under contract to remodel a basement, was going to grind floor for a salt and pepper finish, but discovered it's basically nothing. Thickest portions range up to 2" thick, but most are less. Easy to smash any portion with one swing of the sledge from my hefty 160 pound frame.

Funny thing is it's the second house on the same street where I found this. 1920s homes. Now worth $700-1mil.

Anyone ever encountered one so thin? 

Anyway, looks like this week we're setting up the conveyor, busting up a slab, digging down, and pouring new. Yehaw!

Sent from my SM-T310 using TapatalkIt is what it is...now fix it.:whistlingI see 1/2" slabs all the time, in houses earlier than 1920. Often I will see a thin layer of concrete over bricks, laid flat. No mortar, just laid in place.

I think it was an upgrade, over time. I think alot of houses had dirt basements. Then someone got fancy and laid brick in theirs. Of course everyone had to keep up. Then down the road, someone poured thin concrete over the brick, just to clean it up. I think the concrete was usually in the 40s or 50s. Depending on how high class you were.
This is my opinion only, from being in alot of old houses and commercial buildings.

Regarding concrete in the crawlspace, I think I am the only one in my area that does it. Years ago, people thought I didn't know what I was doing. They regarded it as a waste of money.
Usually when someone sees me do it, their first thought and question is, "What do you think you are doing?"

That's what I have in my basement. 

Dirt floors were quite common in old homes with stone foundations. Bricks were added to keep your feet out of the mud. Odds are the concrete was added after a much later date than construction. 

Mine is cracked and crumbled. I may get around to pulling the brick and pouring in a 2-3" slab over plastic. Maybe someday.Remodeling Contractor Scranton PA

If from both side I would keep the first step at it's current width with a bigger tread. Perhaps reduce the size of the second step to the width of the door. Both steps have the same depth tread.Mike

Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkI have been for years working with the pencil & paper but I would like to find a simpler solution. I know many contractors are switching over to estimating software but it seems like a lot of faith into software.

Are you still double checking the pricing to make sure you don't take a bath on the jobs?

I just have a huge concern. I have seen people take serious losses but even as I get older I can't help but to notice how fast things change...

Thank you,
JohnI would think most contractors are using excel. I'd be more worried about doing a paper estimate than an excel estimate, but obviously you need to be comfortable in excel.

One the things that always amazes me is when a contractor can't step back, look at his estimate and be able to tell if he has the scope covered. I don't mean, "did I miss a door or two?" I mean, "did I miss a floor?"

If you're estimating plumbing for a 2,000 sf house and your bid is $5,000 but that last 10 you did were $10,000...there's probably a problem there. But I still get bids that make no sense from subs.-JohnI still sit down and figure everything out, with a price list while building the job in my mind (ouch!). I don't really know what everyone else does but this is what works for me. I don't want to miss any details and I don't know how software will take eveything into account. But I am sure that it works for some people."I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock" -The BibleI use my fingers. For the bigger jobs I wear flip flops so I can use my toes tooI know what I am trying get some hour for my time. As time goes by I know what my sub are too,maybe not exactly but I know what a days job for some one costs me OK r what a couple of days cost me......that helps a lotI use estimating software. I account for everything. The SOW is hundreds if not thousands of items. It takes time. 24-40 hours for a house, depending on it size and features. It's the only way I know to be sure everything is accounted for. No easy solutions. I get paid for this process. 

I will give broad SF dollar amounts to pre-qualify, but they must pay for a detailed SOW for contractual numbers.It's easy to have a business that is busy.. it's harder to have a business that makes a profitI still do it with pencil and paper, off my checklist. 

After 100 homes, or several hundred thousand feet of concrete, or thousands of ICF blocks, I will be close, within 5% of actual costs every time. But this doesn't happen without a history of doing it. 

For instance, since plumbing was mentioned, I count openings, waste line only, and use a multiplier....add the multiplier again for every upstairs bath, and maybe $1000 for a sewer tie in. Fixtures are always a budget item, meaning I give the client a number to stay within to keep the budget, and if they go over, it is on them. 

HVAC is like $4500 a ton, single story, heat pump, $500 less for gas or electric heat, and double for geo. Easy as that. 

Concrete slabs are $6.25 and footings are so much a foot. Brick has a number, and so on and so on.

Framing packages are $13 a sq/ft typical, and special roof lines and framed second floors push it to $17, and this takes care of trim as well. 

I rough out an estimate in an hour on a 4000 sq/ft home. The checklist has a slot, and that slot has a value. I know Excell would be the way to do this, by why change now?Ladwig Construction​Hennessey, Oklahoma​405 853 1563​

I always just copy the last one and fill in all the lines. Lots and lots is guessing. With remodels I don't know exactly how much work will need to be done. But it's like the Price is Right. At this point, I'm just really good at it and I can generally guess what my subs will cost and how much self performed work everything will take.

The spreadsheet just makes the math easy and accurate, and spits out nice totals for allowance items, self-performed work (the bid fixed price portion of my contracts), and profit.

Been doing it this way since I started WAY back in 2007.

I learned spreadsheets in Junior high math, and it has been one of my most valuable skills.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.I've got a giant spreadsheet with tasks on it with quantities that I fill in.

It's a pretty good solution, but relies on what's in my head... so if I get hit by a bus or something, someone else would have to either start over or do a lot of head-scratching to figure it out.

At the end of the day, I think we'd be better off with a dedicated program that is easily teachable to another person.-AaronJDCOLLUM said:

http://www.zoom-room.comNeed to add outlets, cable and speaker wire to an outer basement wall that is already finished with drywall. Presently having none of this. Only flat open walls...

Problem is when the drywall is cut, no matter how careful with the depth, etc, that plastic vapor barrier will be breached. Opening to maybe a four to six inch line around the room at electrical height.

About the only plus I see is that most of the wall area is above grade because of the generous ground slope outside (except for side walls).

Since the cut in the barrier will be right under the newly cut edge of the existing drywall, how to seal it back up? Not much of a way to slip anything underneath, more so even around the stud areas ...Most guys aren't even going to think twice about this. 

If it were new construction, don't you think there would be a hole in the vapor barrier then also.

If it makes you feel better, how about some window and door foam squirted in there?It can be done but it's super annoying/time consuming. 
If you're really concerned, what you can do is cut the drywall and vapour barrier trench. For the existing edge that has the cutoff drywall and vb, run a bead of acoustical sealant between them that will stick the vb to the back of the the existing drywall. Use gasketed boxes then just install the drywall back in the trench with acoustical seal at the studs. This will maintain the air barrier, vb don't really need to be continuous.Ahh location, location, location - Plastic isn't really needed in your area as compared to Philament & it definitely shouldn't be used in Builditguys area

Your vapor retarder is essentially the paint maybe even the fiberglass with kraft paperSLS Construction & Building Solutions LLC Our Blog - The HTRCIt can be done, but it's a pain. 

Once you've cut out the drywall where you want to, you need to find the screws holding the rest of the board above and below your cut, and remove them too. That will allow you to lift the board away from the studs and seal the joint in the VB with vapour tape.

I would avoid trying to caulk with acousti-seal, only because if you get it in the joint and it contaminates the mud at all you're going to wish you'd been a dentist instead of a renovator.We do it often, fish in front of the insulation where you can, tape up where you cut.

The homeowner is thinking because the vent is right there it was the temperature outside being cold, and heat hitting it directly from the vent that caused the shatter.

6 year old builders grade door, checked for manufacturer, no stickerYep. As long as the glass surface is in great shape, it can take a lot of thermal stress. But if it gets one little dink or scratch, all bets are off. 

The longer it's been there, the more likely it got bonked. Could have happened a year ago, and just now let loose.Probably not heat that caused it to break initially, likely a ding and then the heat, also not all that uncommon for one of the two panes to breakI had one happen to me years ago in the townhouse I was living in.

It was summer though. The A.C was turned way down ...as in cold inside and it was brutally hot outside.

I initially thought an irate husband put a bullet through it.:laughing:"We'll be fine"If someone puts an applied film on the glass, to reduce the solar gain, that will void the manufacturer's warranty. 

I've been told that it can cause glass breakage. Usually it's just a seal failure though.I noticed my comments had disappeared. At first I thought I must have put in something that was offensive. Didn't know what, but I must have, or it wouldn't have been deleted. Since I see the same thing above, that probably wasn't the case. Must have just been computer issues. Or, of course the Russians deleted my post. Either way, I'll put it back up and see if it sticks.

First, I can't stand the term, "builders grade." I'm sure most builders would agree. Most of us use the best quality materials possible. I never want to go back on a job and say, "I can't imagine what went wrong, we used the cheapest products available." Sorry, had to get that out of my system.

I've seen 2 like this. Both about 20 years old, same house, a few years apart. It happened in the middle of the night. The homeowner said it was a loud pop and they thought someone had shot through the window.

Just like the other posters. It happens from time to time. 

Maybe the term "Do it yourself grade." That seems more appropriate.I can't seem to find an appropriate sub-forum for this so I'll try here. Mods can move it if needed...

So I have an apartment to renovate where a grease fire happened about 8 months ago. It's a full gut down to framing and block and is approximately 30'x50' for a scope of ceiling and floor area. It's a second floor unit with concrete ceilings that aren't going anywhere. They are smooth and were painted. Still basically smooth with some bubbled paint here and there but that's whatever. The smoke damage is serious. The entire ceiling is blacker than black and I'm looking for help with cleaning solutions. There's no way I can simply paint over it.

-My original thought was a TSP solution but I'm reading that water based cleaning will embed the smoke even further into the surface. So long as that gets it fairly clean would the possible embedding make much of a difference after a good paint spray job?

-After a little bit of searching I'm thinking the best thing to use would be some powerful degreaser solution. 

Either way the elbow grease involved seems daunting. Even though I'll have guys to do it for me I'm obviously looking for the least laborious yet thorough way. The floors are concrete so I don't have much concern for spillage and messes. I keep wondering if there is some type of pressure washer power scrubber attachment that spins with a return hose connected to the scrubber and hooked to a pump outside to suck the dirty water out. That would seem efficient and fast but likely a dream. 

So who's got real experience with this kind of thing and is willing to share a tip? I've done one fire job several years ago in a house. The smoke damage there was bad but nowhere near what this apartment has. The areas of that house that we had to clean were pretty intense and it still took two coats of Zinnser, iirc, to cover what smoke we couldn't remove. Thanks ahead of time for any help!You might investigate having it performed by a cryogenic cleaning company (dry ice blasting or CO2 blasting).

So, where are you on this project now?Broke?Got a kitchen remodel in an old house. Over a crawlspace, dirt floor. Dirt floor goes under the entire house. Want to tear off the kitchen subfloor and reposition floor joists since there's a larger than one inch drop in one corner.

Should we have to deal with the crawlspace at all? Vapor barrier? And the joists are 2x8s spanning 16'. Old style, thick 2x8s.

Where do you stop with satisfying today's codes? You'd have to rebuild the entire house.Generally, a AHJ thing.

Determined by percentage of the structure you are renovating against the whole enchilada....We really can't tell you--you'll have to contact your local AHJ for an authoritative answer.

But given the content of your post, you have a clue as to what should be done. Don't you think it would be a bit irresponsible not to do that whether legally required to or not?Depends on the location of the house, in NJ they are very specific and inspector usually try to enforce incorrectly.dutchroots2 said:

Here, anything you bring out of code by means of remodeling, has to be brought back to current code.Mike.
_______________In NJ we have a Rehab code separate from the building code. It specifies what can and can't be done without filing for a permit. They break down into categories and so forth.

Check with your building department if the have something like this also.

It basically breaks down into sections something like this:

1. Ordinary maintenance and it tells you that:

(a) Ordinary maintenance to structures may be made without filing a permit application with or without giving notice to the construction official and it tells you what falls under that and it tells you what doesn't:
(b) Ordinary maintenance shall not include any of the following:
1. The cutting away of any wall, partition or portion thereof;
2. The removal or cutting of any structural beam or bearing support;
3. The removal or change of any required means of egress, or rearrangement of parts of a structure affecting
the exit way requirements;
4. Any work affecting structural or fire safety;
5. Any work that will increase the nonconformity of any existing building or structure with the requirements of the regulations;
ETC.

After that, you have another section that tells you when a permit is required.

2.Construction permits--when required

(a) It shall be unlawful to construct, enlarge, repair, renovate, alter, reconstruct or demolish a structure, or change the use of a building or structure, or portion thereof, or to install or alter any equipment for which provision is made or the installation of which is regulated by this chapter without first filing an application with the construction official, or the appropriate subcode official where the construction involves only one subcode, in writing and obtaining the required permit therefor.
ETC.

Good luckI never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​I need to add some top mount, recessed countertop supports (steel) to an existing finished half wall. What's your method to get these nice and perfectly level? I would like to leave the drywall on one side unscathed.

If you have a Surplus Warehouse in your area, they are pretty quick and have a huge variety instock.Winter is just hitting my area and I've got a home I suspect may have ice dam issues soon. The home has 3" of 2# foam (+/- r-21) at roof deck. 3/4 of the home also has r-19 in cathedral ceiling rafters with some air space above to sprayfoam. There is no airflow or ridgevent being the roof rafters are locked foam from eave to ridge.

This home could use a new roof. I am considering metal and retrofitting some type of sheet good foam above a created airflow gap. Home is about an 8/12 pitch with straight peak.

Thoughts?I'm not a roofer by any means, but what makes you think it will have ice dam issues? Is there previous damage indicating ice damming is a seasonal thing with the home?Thanks for responding. The home is coming "online" now and we've had good snowfall. The home is showing snow melt with minor ice forming. I am concerned it will continue and potentially become an issue so just doing some preemptive brainstorming. The home is small, so snow raking it is an easy temporary solution, if it does show significant melt. Right now it's hard to tell.

Although melt appears to be uniform, the home has its furnace and on-demand water heater in he conditioned attic, which is adding to some heat trap above living area.Adding an airspace, then foam, and a metal roof isn't going to make sense. Putting foam on the decking, then an airspace and a metal roof with ridge vent could help.

Heat cables are sometime used, but they have drawbacks.

Normal roofing would require ~2 rows of ice and water shield installed along the eaves to guard against ice dams getting water into the building.Maybe examine the vent area in the attic (i.e. 1sqft vent: 300sqft attic floor area)? Obviously it sounds like the furnace and HW heater isn't helping.My thought on a layer of foam over air space is isolating the heat from the roof covering. I think that would function better than just adding more insulation to the overall roof system, ie foam on top of decking. Although that would keep more heat inside. My concern is even with more insulation on roof, it'll still have heat transfer.

Anything that would be done would include eave to ridge venting.

HDAVIS, why do think it wouldn't do much?CharlieDelta said:

This is the primary issue with spray foamed roof decks, there is no venting; at least with this home.META said:

If you were adding anything, it would be foam first, then an air gap then roofing. The continuous foam will alleviate the thermobridging problems, then you'd have the venting to keep the roof surface colder.

If you put the venting first, you'd be wasting a lot of money on foam just to "solve" an ice damming problem, but you'd still be allowing heat to escape from the home at almost the same rate it currently is. You want to make the home more energy efficient as well as less prone to ice damming, not just the latter.META said:

You want the ventilation to keep the roof at outside air temp so you don't get uneven melting / freezing. If you put the metal on the foam and have the ventilation under the foam, you don't have effective ventilation of the roof system, and you don't get full value of the added insulation.

A lot of people will do a metal roof retrofit by just adding the sheet insulation over the deck, putting on ply or OSB on top, and installing a (thin) metal roof over that. I don't see a lot of ice dam problems on ones done that way.I appreciate each of your input. I think the likelihood of noticeably increasing the thermal envelope on the roof end will be negligible in terms of what needs to be done to eliminate an ice dam. It sounds like I was over thinking this with considering air gap and foam, where a layer of decent foam could take care of it all together.Air gap is easy to create with a cold roof. If you dont need any more insulation its pretty low cost as well. 2x2s over current sheathing and sheet over that. Other than increaseing height at fascia and rakes its not a huge retrofit.PatChap said:

I agree with that. He's in Michigan, so moving closer to the R-38 recommendation before putting the metal on wouldn't be a bad thing.Here's the kicker, much of the roof system has about R-40 when including the R-19 bat fiberglass under the foam. I really think the roof needed higher R-values without the ventilation of excess heat. This thought is what had me concerned with just adding another layer of foam.META said:

If it's that good, you should be able to just switch over to a cold roof without adding any more insulation.Is the heat that is creating the ice damns actually from the roof, or is it from the wall system/window/doors? even a basement heat leak? plumbing stack? R40 and no air flow shouldn't allow any ice damns....

Can you borrow a infrared camera?I might be an Idiot, but I know things that You don't: Please wait till after you get my know-how to insult me....The ice forming is fairly even along both eaves. No basement. It is about 20 degrees cooler today where yesterday and Monday were closer to just under freezing. I could be "freaking" out about nothing.

An R40 hot roof can still have ice damming. All of the rafters will allow heat to escape. Then again, sunlight can cause ice damming too, so it's a crap shoot sometimes.24 winters fighting ice damming. There are things that can be done to help a little. Solving it ? No chance

The first thing that comes up on Google for Nylodeck is an article about the Nyloboard company going up for sale. :sad:dang that sucks, I'm sorry about that. I can't think of any other material without expansion that's solid other than tile or a hardwood.

If by chance you did find some nylo decking the warranty would be invalid. I would call some contractors and see if there's similar products.

Thats a shame ya know I think nylodeck was the only company to come out with a board without expansion for decks.Check out Wolf Products...the Estate and Americana collections might be a good fit.

Poplar or D / clear pine for stained window trim.We've used AZEK pvc for new jambs with a lot of success. We also use primed poplar with clear pine or poplar inside stools as well. Like Randy says, if they are staining their interior trim casing, then we use pine.- John Williams

I am always suprised by the first call mentioning hte need for a remodel because the holidays are coming. 

Does anyone else get these influx of calls and requests leading up to the holidays?

To me it seems counter-intuitive. The holidays are pricey times without adding my bill to your list but hey - I am not complaining and my kids thank you too!

:thumbup:No, fall and winter are usually my busiest times but not because of the holidays. My clients know better than to expect me to get to a major remodel as if I'm sitting around waiting for their call.We get busy with roofing in fall too. Its because people are done with vacations and they put it off to when the kids are in school.I've gotten that allot over thirty years. We want to get out kitchen done. Can you do it by thanks giving? And this is in September. As if there aren't going to be anymore holidays. 
If I tell people no, they get the first person that can do it for them. It never fails that in time I hear through the grape vine about how unhappy they are with the job. People are so focused on getting that new kitchen by the holidays that when the holidays are over and they have to live with it. Reality sinks in

This project involved digging and then pouring new basement footing, installing large posts and beams to handle taking out structural walls, sistering joists, and in general many of the elements of both new construction and remodel. 13 doors, 8 windows, 3000 feet of drywall, 1200 feet of flooring and tile, 1000 feet of trim. Medium sized remodel. 

What's a typical job for you?You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.This could be fun and interesting, but you need to consider what a “typical” job is and how different “typical” may be for different companies. Here is our “typical”:

Kitchen demo to move in ready: 10 – 12 weeks. (note we don’t do kitchens under $80k and typical (average over the last 5 years is $140k).

Master bath demo to move in ready: 8 - 10 weeks. (we don’t do masters under $50k and typical is $70k).

Hall or kids bath (3 fixtures): 3 weeks. 

Basement finish: 10 weeks to 28 weeks depending on size and detail.

Also note that we have some incredible inspection hoops to jump through. We did a 3 fixture bath in January that scheduled out at 9 working days. Add 5 days of inspections for a total of 14 days on site. 36% of the project timeline was for inspections.I love what I do and I'm very good at it!

Remodels, especially on older projects, can wreak havoc with schedules with unforseen/unknowns.

Remodels are also notorious for changes after people see the project underway.

A true custom home can also have the tendency to come out slightly different than the plans.

When I was at Tahoe weather often had quite a role in delaying a project.

Inspections out here can also cause quite a delay.

Now if you add design/plans/engineering/permits to the process.....Closed on a tear down for a lot split in May. Still waiting on electrical company to disconnect gas and elec to tear down. Then can submit for lot split - 6-8 weeks. Then can submit for plan review 4-8 weeks. Then can pull building permits to build two new homes... 8 months. We'll be close to one year from purchase to start of construction.All over the board. Depends on if the client follows selections calender and selection sheets, weather, subs honesty on schedules and how detailed the project is. I have a 400k + remodel of a lake cottage that is going to be done around Christmas making it 11 months. My brother is running one an hour a way that is twice as big and a lot more money and will be done at 6-7 months. Maybe 8. Details and selections. Change orders. Subs.

No doubt speed is money. I was running the numbers on my current project. It only takes a couple weeks over time and my empoyee ends up with more in his pocket than me. A couple weeks ahead and I can give him a fat bonus and still make great money.

I have never been delayed much by inspections. Here one inspector does all, but they will send a guy who worked in the trade depending on the inspection and what the project is. Engineering and permitting yes, but I was not counting that in my timelines. I can almost always work on something else while waiting on inspection. My current project had these inspections 17 inspections in 7 visits:



Erosion control and setback at the same time
Footings twice (complex so had to do two pours. inspector phone approved second one), Ufer ground at the same time
slab reinforcement
shearwall
plumbing, mechanical, electric rough, framing and fireblocking all at the same time. They were busy so I was pushed a day

Really its the part of the house where you get alot of activity..thanks from roosterI've got a customer who wants the stucco removed from her house and then resided with wood. Anyone have a number per 100 sq. ft. for the weight and volume of stucco. Anyone done this? What kind of time does it take? Any other tips? Tks, Rich.From where does knowledge come? If you need to know what is in a box, you could ask someone (not reliable), you could pray, (not useful), you can consult with the scripture (not helpful) or you could open the box (science)I've done a few stucco tearouts. I don't have the math down on the weight. The hardest thing is busting or cutting it into manageable size pieces. I have run across different densities, but the pain the butt part is the wire.

You could probably do the calcualtion based on concrete weight and factor a little less. On tearouts I worked on the stucco was from 3/4" to about 1 1/4" thick. 1"x12"x12" will give you the volume. Find the weight for a given volume and do the math.I'm Really In A Place Where I'm Not Trying To Be Anything Other Than What I Am.:clap:I did the math

If I did the math correctly, it should be 12.5 lbs per square foot for concrete. Stucco is probably a little less.:thumbup: 1100-1200lbs per 100 s.f is my guess.I'm Really In A Place Where I'm Not Trying To Be Anything Other Than What I Am.:clap:Thanks for that, can you cut it into chunks while still on the wall, then get it to the dumpster? seems that would be easier than dealing with the wire/stucco in a heap on the ground.

Glad I had someone to take turns on it that day.I demo a 40x10 plaster and wire lath ceiling to raise it. Clearly swinging a sledge up is not gonna happen. The best solution i came up with was to use an angle grinder with a segmented diamond wheel to cut the plaster/wire ceiling into 2' x 2' chunks and then ply them off with a crowbar. Be sure to have a row of 2x4s to catch the dropping plaster block because a 85 lbs block dropping 6.5 feet will put holes in your subfloor.

Not this ceiling, I swung a 4 lbs sledge at it and it just bounced off without a scratch. It's 2" of hard plaster with 2 layers of wire lath throughout. Even after cutting it into 2'x2' pieces, I can hang my full body weight on a piece and it won't budge.dont build em like they used to! Even the dang rusty nails are stronger than some new ones.The previous owner was a plasterer (go figure). The place is a Sear manufactured home with 2x3 lattice framed walls. I initially thought it had full 2x4 walls because the guy slapped so much plaster on top of it. EVERYTHING is plastered with full wire lath, sometimes doubled up. I think the plaster, rather than the framing is what is holding the roof up.I'm bidding a bath remodel that involves a steam shower. The 4' x 5' shower is located in the corner with a 13' high vaulted ceiling above. For aesthetics, I would really like to avoid building the soffit all the way up to the top, I would like to build a lid to sit above the shower and leave open above the newly created ledge. There is a closet framed out in the other corner with a height of 8'4". It would look best to match the height and keep it proportioned. 

The ceiling of the shower will be 7'6" or so, to allow for ceiling mounted shower head. So the height of this soffit will be around 12" tall. There are no adjacent joist in the side walls to cantilever framing and no support on two sides of this structure where the glass panels will be. 

Has anyone done a similar install before? I'm trying to see what options I can come up with. The pic attached is a similar install, but is on the low side and they tied it into the ceiling, which I need to avoid.Remodeling Contractor Scranton PA

Could even frame out the rest in steel, cap both top and bottom with 3/4" osb/plywood and it should be nice and rigid.Not sure why I didn't think of steel, considering I started the trades setting red iron. Seems like the perfect solution. 

Now I have to determine what steel to use..sh!t makes my head hurt using calculators to spec material. I think channel or angle will be needed over flat bar, if I were to go with a short 2"-3" profile. The outer rim will be 2x10 with 2x4 joist recessed to hide the sloped ceiling. I would like to keep the steel above the joist framing. 



Thank you all.Remodeling Contractor Scranton PA

Scranton PA Kitchen RemodelingAfter the L frame steel , frame it out with light weight steel studs or joists 12" o.c. Then use foam board for ceiling lid. Tile it with large thin tile. Put in insulation from above and close the top off with 3/8 floor grade plywood glue and screwed.That's essentially my plan. As of know, I anticipate using C3x6 channel bolted to 11 1/4" LVL for the rim so the intermediate joist are recessed into the lid.

At that height, you can't see it from the the outside.I have a potential client who is looking for someone to tear down a small portion of their home (which is currently built on piers) and rebuild it bigger on top of a new foundation and basement. They plan to eventually add a second story to their home, and the piers are insufficient support for such an addition. There is a preexisting basement which has a ceiling height of 6.5'. They want to dig out the basement floor 2' and then connect to the new basement (under the small section which will be torn down and rebuilt with larger footprint.) This would involve removing half of one of the 4 foundation walls and installing a steel header in its place and then widening the footer under the bearing points of this header.

To lower the floor of the current basement I was planning on busting up the current concrete floor, digging out my pedestal footers for my new support columns, then underpinning the foundation walls 4' at a time (I would not underpin the wall section which will be removed to connect to the new basement. After this is done, I will tear down the small pier supported section, start digging the new foundation, then rebuild it.

Does anyone have experience with doing anything of this sort, i.e. connecting a new basement to an old? I have lowered basement floors, but haven't done anything involving basement footprint expansions.

Watch us at work: http://bit.ly/2bfBRPIWe’re looking at a possible project that would require lowering a living room floor. It’s currently raised two 5-1/2” risers (11 inches) from the floor elevations of the rest of the house. The living room has a cathedral ceiling.

We’ve never done this before and my initial thought is that it looks too easy. Here’s what I’m seeing and I just don’t want to miss something, so if you guys see something I missed in the plan (just concept at this time) speak up.

•	The basement below is unfinished and the existing framing is exposed.
•	It looks like they simply framed the first floor walls (balloon frame) then attached (for lack of a better word) rim joists to the framed walls – 11 inches higher then installed hangers and joists.
•	It looks like I can simply remove the existing floor framing install a new mud sill (inside the existing mud sill) set the new joists and sheath.
•	There are a couple of heat ducts that would need to be lowered – it’s unfinished basement and a path for them is clear.
•	All the outlets and switches would need to be lowered.
•	Then drywall the 11 inch void.
•	We’re done.

This would be part of a much larger project (all floorings are being replaced on the rest of this floor), so flooring is not an issue.

I’m guessing every fifth house has this “1985 design enhancement”. If we can do it at a reasonable price, we may get to do several in the neighborhood. Most folks with this model probably want it gone once they figured out that it’s really a PITA for furniture placement and flow of living space.

We were originally contacted to remodel the kitchen, family room and replace all the floorings. I gave them a ballpark and they agreed to a design agreement. Then they asked if I could give them the option to lower the living room floor in my design/budget. 

My initial thought was “that’s going to pretty expensive”. We went to gather the as-built info and I spent some time looking at it and all of a sudden I’m thinking “maybe not so bad”.

More fire blocking?SLS Construction & Building Solutions LLC Our Blog - The HTRCNo insulation issues? It should be continuous already, but who knows.

Fire blocking shouldn't be an issue - it would have been done to the full wall height originally. Worst case is some goes in at the bottom of the wall.

A lot of first floors are wired from the basement. That could be a lot of rewiring, or just a lot of junction boxes added in the basement....

The framing should be easy, like you say, and I second Tom's put the new joist system in before taking out the old floor system if possible.Just off the top of my head HVAC, plumbing, central vac, electrical are some issues I would be concerned with.

Most of the outlet wiring is visible from the basement. You can actually see the loops running from outlet to outlet. Since they’ll be getting lower, so the need for junction boxes should be minimized.

1940's story and a half house. Finished attic. Adding a full bath. Home is stucco and for budget a other reasons it would be ideal not to replace the window. The design calls for a claw-foot tub with one of those three handle showers mounted in the center of it. The shower (centered on tub) would be 6" away from a non-tempered window.

Does anybody know the Residential Code requirement for spacing between the shower and window (is 6" OK) and window requirements (In the past when things like windows in stairs that desire tempered glass the building official will let me put a fall guard instead of replacing with tempered glass).60" above any standing or walking surface, or it's tempered glass.

I am doing some research on the possibility of adding a second story onto my 1924 home. I am trying to gain some insight on what the 2 to 3 foot wide 48" tall stepped sections adjacent to my basement wall are for. They go around the perimeter of 3 of the 4 basement walls. Were these added to the home some time after its initial construction while turning a crawlspace into a full height basement? Or do they have some other purpose?, i.e to function as a type of footer for the foundation walls? Here is a photo of my basement.Thanks in advance for any input on this.We can only make assumptions, I never seen anyone doing that, but who knows who did that and what were they thinking. 
Maybe they didn't expected so much dirt to come out, so they left some dirt around perimeter,formed around it and filled it with concrete or whatever they used there or maybe they were afraid existing crawlspace foundation caving in after dirt was removed, so they did that to provide additional support... WTF knows what they were thinking.I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​I've seen that don't to older foundations in an attempt to sure up a degrading stone foundation. Usually only go as high as the grade outside. Also to stop water penetration through the failed mortar.


Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkRegardless of why someone did that, you will need to dig some test pits to verify what the existing footer conditions are. Then consult with a PE and get his take on whether your existing foundation is capable of handling the increased load of a second story.

Anything else is just speculation.Tom

www.gebcon.comLots of time it was done on older houses with no real basement just a hole for the furnace. Then people decided to do a basement ,dug them out and did a wall like that to hold back the dirt and foundation of the old walls. Very common around here to see.We would need more information before we could advise you. There are several possibilities.
1) The inside wall carried the original building and a porch or addition was added later.
2) Someone made a crawl space into a basement.
3) It was originally built as a basement with porch around the perimeter and at some time someone replaced porch columns with a stemwall.Michael Gookin, President

(239) 848-6675Ok, I will get out there and dig a few pits to see what the circumstance is with those 3 walls. As I said before, however, this stepping is only done on 3 of the 4 foundation walls. So 1 of them I can see goes to the floor of the basement (84" H). This I find strange...

There was an addition to the home maybe 40 years ago, but its footprint extends beyond the footprint of the basement walls. It sits on 4x4s supported by concrete blocks (something I will change)
ThanksAll of the ones I've seen that on had unstable stone foundations that were encased in concrete.Well from the digging I've done so far, the soil here is pretty rocky. So this seems to correspond with your experience. Then those steps are probably solid concrete all the way back to the exterior foundation walls?. While not definitive (you need an architect/structural engineer), those are quite common place where you are digging adjacent to an existing foundation wall for the purpose of things like making a cellar/basement where there was only a crawl space, or to increase ceiling height. 

You have some other items that are somewhat strange going on as well.
Whats going on with that beam support? It looks as if the concrete was formed around the post a little bit. Looks like some reinforcing work was done previously, it is possible that the house had shifted previously, maybe due to inadequate foundation. It is also possible they decided to fix the problem, and while "they were in there" decided to dig out a little more. 

What is the black piping in pic 1? And what is that pipe opening in pic 2?So In the first photo you are just seeing the old carburetor from my truck hanging down off the ledge, things are a bit messy as ive just moved in 2 months ago...

The posts are not cemented in. What you are seeing is actually blue-gray paint that ended up on the post when they painted the foundation walls.

The pipe in the second photo is a remnant of what I believe was an incinerator or coal furnace of some sort. It was built into the stepped section of the wall. Here are some additional photos. One of them pictures the inside of this "furnace". The walls, at least in this section, do extend all the way down to the floor of the basement. The space is comprised of cinder blocks.

As far as I can tell, the current basement heights was always this high. The cement composition and texture seems consistent throughout. I dont think the stepped walls were from a crawlspace being converted into a full heights space, but I could be mistaken.

I will consult a structural engineer.The more I look at things, The most I think all the walls are cinderblock cover with cement.Thanks for posting on ContractorTalk.com. The Moderators of this forum would prefer that you post Do It Yourself related topics on our sister site www.DIYChatroom.com

We apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused. This thread has been closed.I need some help- I am rehabbing an old camp. The floor joists are old timbers (6X6) and are several feet apart. Some are 4 feet apart as opposed to the usual 16 or 24" on center joists. How do I insulate this floor with fiberglass insulation? I do not want to spend the money on spray foam. Any ideas on how to do this with fiberglass?Staple netting on and blow it.hdavis said:

This is your better route. If your dead set on fiberglass then you will have to get some twine, like you see on bales of hay and straw. Staple the twine across your joist every ten inches and slide in your fiberglass.You can blow it with fiberglass or rock wool. Fiberglass is cheaper, rock wool is better in that application, IMO.

Rock wool is better against the sill - that could be hand insulated with batts before blowing the rest with fiberglass.Are rodents an issue? If so I wouldn't do fiberglass. Although you could put up plywood to cover it and stop penetration. Rigid foam could also work, but it is expensive.What about just insulating underpinning around the outer perimeter with foam board?Hey guys,

Have a demo job coming up and would like to get on board with some (semi) proper dust containment. I'm going to be getting some zipwall or similar system to contain the area, however I would like to do some negative air pressure as well. 

In the past I have stuck a box fan in a window and this has helped, sure, but would like to hook up an air filter fan or similar possibly in addition to a fan out the window. 

I'm not familiar with CFM's. Would this thing be better suited to be hooked up a hose out the window to make negative pressure, or used standalone inside the room as just a filter?

The job in question is demo'ing an entire kitchen/dining room to the studs/joists. I would also be using them in the future for other remodelling jobs.

Thanks!Aztec Decks
Oshawa deck builderInteresting question, I'm curious to read what others suggest. I'd probably just run it inside to filter the room air, of course it depends who (what) the exhaust air is blowing on to outside the building. 

This is also interesting http://www.leevalley.com/en/wood/page.aspx?p=65482&cat=1,42401 (I've never used it.)I have used the ridggid version of that shop vac and it did ok for negative air. I then stepped up to 8" blower with ducting out window and it did fine except in winter. 

You can try the 8" blower set up with ducting at http://www.harborfreight.com/8-inch-portable-ventilator-97762.html

they also make a 12" version that BCC uses http://www.northerntool.com/shop/to...ntent=547589&gclid=CJ_Oh7-Lws4CFQioaQodrcQPsg

I now use the Ermator A600 hepa scrubber and it works 100 times better than anything else I tried. You can vent clean air out into area or use it inside the work space.I bought a 8", 1600 cfm fan from Harbor freight for $85. It hooks up to flex duct so I can put it inside the work area but vent up to 20' away.

The key to negative air is to vent outside the work area.Jaws;1780140 said:

Oshawa deck builderI have a fan similar to this https://www.homehardware.ca/en/rec/...pqfZ67l/Ne-lo2m/Ntk-All_EN/R-I5245186?Ntt=fan, it works well as long as nobody on site weighs less than 150lbs. Princess Auto has similar fans and I've seen them come up on KIJIJI occasionally.I have to be careful around here of blowing a cloud of dust out the window. I generally filter the air.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.I always forget about princess auto! I bet this would do the trick. 2000 cfm it claims!

I haven't actually seen the the Shopvac one in action but I was told it has only been used for small jobs and it worked just fine.

Techno Metal Post - SJ Web SiteNot sure what your budget is... I have a couple of the BuildClean units and love them. They work great for filtering & recirculating the air in the space or as a negative pressure setup. Not cheap, but so far seems like a good investment. 

They really do keep the air clean. Sometimes when working, just breathing in the clean air makes me stop & think about what conditions i worked in when i was younger. I feel it is important to provide a safe work environment for my employees, and BuildClean helps me do that. Also helps to set you apart from the competition.Not sure if this is the right place to post about this.......... I need to replace the windows in my own house with solid vinyl windows. I don't do replacement windows as part of my business so I am not really informed on what brands are good and bad. Based on the condition of the current windows in my house which are 25 year old Malta vinyl clad wood frames and sash, I need to pull them out completely and use new construction windows as replacements. Been looking around trying to find reviews on the internet, but not getting anything worthwhile. Not sure if I trust any of the products from the big box stores either. What I need is some first hand information about good quality and cost for vinyl windows . Any information would be helpful, good or bad.If you wait a few hours, you can hear from others how bad of a contractor you are, because you don't know how to change windows, "one of the most requested services for contractors."

Hopefully with this comment, the trolls have been discouraged.

Can your local lumberyard give suggestions or advice?



Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkMetal Industries makes a pretty decent window.

I haven't had the chance to use them, but I've heard a lot of good stuff about Okna windows. 


Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkYour location is a factor when looking for window or door replacements. I am in Ohio and prefer the Wincore 7700 for replacement and 500 series for new construction options. Both series can be custom ordered to size and have all the latest bell and whistle options available. There are other brands that make quality vinyl products also, Siminton is one to note in my area. I just think Wincore pays a bit more attention to detail. 

Deciding between using replacement or new construction units completely depends on your project. For example, if the window is faced in brick or stone, you usually will have to go with a replacement unit. If your house has wood or vinyl siding, a new construction unit may be better as they are easier to properly flash for weather and can be ordered with built in J-channel to speed and simplify the exterior finish work.

Oh, when insulating, stay 10 miles away from the foam. I don't care if it says it is for windows right on the can. Take the time and use fiberglass, do not over stuff it, it should be fluffy. For small cracks use silicone or butyl. 

By the way, not knowing much about windows does not make you a bad contractor. I do work all the time for guys in other trades. I also never hesitate to call them when i get outside my own comfort level.Thanks Moods for the info. Will look into those brands. I also have a Harvey windows distributor in my area if you have ever heard of them. Not sure of the quality of their product, but they do advertise a lot on TV. I see you are new here, once you get to know the forum you will find out that some of the responses aren't very kind and are often insulting. I choose not to do replacement windows because its a very competitive business in my area and I just don't' need the aggravation of measuring, ordering, not getting jobs I spend time bidding on etc. Besides, I am so busy all the time with the other work that I do I don't need to do windows.:no:Harvey makes a good window. But I have to respectfully disagree with moods suggestion to stay away from foam. When properly installed, foam does a much better job than fiberglass. It actually air seals the gap, which fiberglass doesn't do. You just need to be careful with it and obviously only use door and window foam. I've never had a problem with it bowing in windows/doors. 


Sent from my iPad using Tapatalkif you can not foam a window you should not give advice on what is a good window in my book.:thumbsup:I have simplified my window choices down to Anderson only.
Why?
Because when I call or need service on existing I get it as fast as I need.Definitely depends on physical location, but here in NW Ohio I use tons of Simonton windows...New construction line is the ProFinish, and replacements are Reflection series (they have a nicer frame than the Asure series). 

The basic rule of thumb for insulating windows with foam vs fiberglass for me is to say this: If you're going to foam them, get a foam gun. It's the only way I do it anymore. The single use cans are a joke, you're better off with fiberglass...BUT...since getting a foam gun I've never fiberglassed a window or door since. It's clean and controllable, and seals drafts in the best possible way!

Definitely measure twice and make a list...then check it all again before ordering the new windows...and pay attention to the details of what you want (which way do you want the casements to open? Sliders to open which direction?) Think about the grills too, there's a billion design options these days!www.stratmanconstruction.com
Like us on Facebook!Just as an FYI - using fiberglass is essentially against the codes in every state & every manufacturers directions I can think of

Your big name long term companies all make some good windows (most here including me generally go Marvin first) - just check the options & watch the NFRC ratings. Beyond that the worst window installed properly will out perform the best window installed improperlySLS Construction & Building Solutions LLC Our Blog - The HTRCI know it may get me some grief, but a vinyl window is a vinyl window. Any window from the major brands in your area should be a decent window. Properly installed it will perform well and last forever.

I use Milgard mostly, but have gone to Cascade for rentals. Good window and it is a bit less in cost. You can spend more and get a better energy ratings in any manufacturer, but in the real world, unless you are in a very cold or hot area, it probably doesn't matter.

Then it is a combination of coatings and gases. Some manufacturers swear by their special frame extrusions or magic materials. There is a difference between the low end and top end windows in a line, but to me it doesn't make that much difference in performance. In pleasure to use, locks and feel it does for sure. But around here, the weather is pretty mild. Never had a complaint.

Still do your research. Years ago, it wasn't so easy. Some of the vinyl windows would let air through the weather beads and sash gaps. Haven't had that problem in a long time around here.

All that said, I don't don't do high end window installs, my customers don't roll that way, so I am talking about the standard lines here.

Another question would be what is wrong with the ones you have now? Improper installation, frame failure, rot, etc.?

Oh, yeah. A foam gun is probably the best thing you can get for windows and doors. It is a game changer. Besides making it easier and cleaner to install, it also is way cheaper. One can will do two or three houses with properly measured windows, where the single cans might get you a couple windows before they dry up. Also, foaming the windows makes them feel more solid and tight.SLSTech said:

Table 1102.4.2 from 2009 IRC & everyone since
http://thehtrc.com/2013/getting-details-right-air-barrier 










It specifically states that "air permeable" aka fiberglass may not be used as a sealant - ahh but I use caulk, then technically you are fine as that is the "sealant" but many inspectors will fail you if they see it. 

As for manufacturers, check out their directionsSLS Construction & Building Solutions LLC Our Blog - The HTRCwow...
Using Fiberglass is perfectly fine anywhere. Fiberglass insulation has nothing to do with sealing the unit. Sealing the unit is done with proper flashing and siding on the exterior of the wall. The fiberglass is simply used to insulate dead space between the wall framing and the window unit itself.
Using foam to insulate this dead space will do the same thing as the fiberglass. It is also quicker so long as you don't get it on anything it shouldn't be on. 

My problem with the foam is that it will lock the jambs in place. This makes things tougher for the trim installers. If they happen to have to pull the middle of the jamb in to straighten it up it will break the foam creating more dead space. If they have to push a jamb away, well they can't, not without butchering the foam insulation. Fiberglass has the ability to expand and contract (to an extent) without compromising the R-Value.

Maybe I'm just old school.When it was said, foam is against building code. I don't know about that. I do know it is against the Energy code.

Jan 1, 2012. It became Federal law that all states had to comply with the Energy Code. Before that, the energy code was there, but it also said states could do what they wanted. In 2012 that changed.

Foam gun is by far the best way to go. They work amazingly well. 

As far as fiberglass around a window or door. Yes it is against the energy code. No it doesn't void any warranty. No, it doesn't bow the sides of the window. You have to use the window and door foam. Not the other stuff. It is different.

It was explained to me as this. Fiberglass around a window acts like a cigarette filter. It will slow down the air movement, but it won't stop it. Foam will stop it. Also, if your gap is too narrow for foam, caulking is approved. Because caulking will stop air flow. 

If you've ever had a blower door test done, this becomes evident really quick.

Back to the point of the post. Your location will make a difference on what windows are available. Post your location and someone from your area will most likely be able to help you.

I work all the time, to not be old school. I've learned I need to adapt. Believe it or not, some of the new methods are pretty good.OSI foam is def the way to go. If the windows are pushing out, you can use squeeze clamps to pull them in flush before foaming. Foam provides so much more structural support, especially with inserts. 

Harvey windows are good. I've used plenty of them. Many options for glass packages, hardware, colors, etc.Checked around and found Simonton and Viwinco are top sellers in my area. Will check out some sample windows tomorrow and probably will go with the Simontons. Thanks for all the input.Can't imagine anyone who installs windows on a regular basis would use fiberglass on their own house. Doesn't that say all it needs to say. Window and door foam is the way to go.I am greatly disturbed by the amount of ignorance displayed on this forum regarding proper air sealing and insulating practices as it applies to window installation. 

As far as I can tell, the OP was asking for advice on brands, not install practices. He already knows he wants new construction style vinyl. 

I don't know what part of the country he is in, but if he is in Milgard territory, I would advise using their Tuscany series for replacement. 

I would advise against MI and Cascade. That is from personal experience with both of those brands. 

Simonton is good as well. 

Andersen has some good lines and some not so good lines. Their Vinyl clad wood product is crap though, and I would avoid it. 

As for all of this foam talk, Jesus Christ people, Fiberglass is allows air movement, and is specifically not recommended in our jusrisdiction. 
I've removed more windows than you have, and I can promise you that all of the dirty fiberglass I remvoed from window jamb cavities, is dirty because air is flowing across it. Thats why furnace filters are made out of fiberglass. It's porous. Yes, you caulk and tape the nailfin. Air still gets through. Using foam designed for windows and doors is the preferred method. I use Touch-n-Seal. It is AAMA approved. The window installer should verify his jambs are straight and true before foaming. Since I install and trim my own windows, that has been a non issue for me. 

But seriously, if you're still using fiberglass to insulate window and door jamb cavities, you need to join the 21st century and get educated.Need some input on where to get a good deal on kitchen cabinets and counter tops. My first go-to would be HD, just looking for other options as well. 

This is for a basement remodel that's getting a kitchen area. It's being done for resale value so it should look decent but also be fair priced.

YouTubeHoping someone can give me some insight on this.

I'm doing a remolded bonus room for a client that was previously a garage, and they have been complaining about this oil smell coming from one side of the room. We took the sheet rock down and the sill plate where the garage door used to be appears to have been painted black, or has this black coating. Which there is about a 8' section that is giving off a very pungent oil smell. Almost like a kerosene or diesel fuel. There is no extended footing in this area because this is where the garage door was, and there is asphalt that is adjacent to it that might be giving off the smell? But doesn't explain why only a portion is giving off the smell.

Anyone know what this is and why is smells this way? Can this be covered up with a killz primer? See pics below.

The exterior sheathing is fiberboard sheathing.

You can see the insulation is sticking to the area that smells, and that sheen your seeing is not liquid, its a hard glossy surface. Which makes me think its some kind of coating for the sill plate.No help from me on the smell, but if that is truly a cocker spaniel standing in the mess you need to get him out of there before he chews on something he shouldn't.220...221...whatever it takes!Lumber that was used as a concrete form is sometimes coated in oil to prevent the concrete from sticking to it. So maybe that piece of wood used to be a concrete form.

Also, I know petroleum products were/are used to protect lumber from the elements. Wood on car haulers and other open trailers, for example.Reminds me of a piece of marine lumber.Maybe they spilled a bunch of used oil there?Almost sounds like an oiled asphalt. Could be that someone did that instead of using PT.rselectric1 said:

lmao!My guess would be the same as Youngin' and hdavis mentioned.
It looks like some form of creosote or asphalt. 
If it is creosote, it would really have a strong penetrating odor. That stuff can definitely preserve wood. I had to remove several creosoted pilings from a marina and they were still dry and fresh inside after being submerged for more than forty years under water.I would try some paint made for painting lines on asphalt. I forget the name of it, but I bought it at an Ace hardware store. The stuff really stopped the smell of the remaining asphalt glue after I removed a bunch of old asphalt tiles. The combination of the asphalt glue with the paint on top also seemed to prevent moisture damage from the slab underneath.To get rid of an offensive odor you can try encapsulating it....

but the best way is to remove it.

Grind the affected concrete area and fill/float it. If you can't remove the sill, seal the bejeezus out of it.

Well I was wondering if anyone has heard of any bad experiences coming from or because of re-bath or bath fitters?? I have a customer that I was getting ready to redo their bathroom to the extent of $30000. Well someone from re-bath went door knocking and so my customer allowed them in to present. They are just pricing covering up the tub and tile whereas I am pricing taking a cramped bathroom and restructuring walls to give them a huge bathroom on a 2nd floor. Not counting they picked out a $4000 tub and marble tile. Well enough about what I priced but they may sell their house and so they are wondering if re-bath would be a better solution since they can be in and out in 2 days. I would like to find something to present them with to try to keep them away from them. I could replace the tub and tile that they have for probrably around the same price as they charge to cover everything with acrylic. Well guys hope you can help me out.Oh what the years have taught me in the industry...

What they do and what you do are totally different. If there is some confusion between the two of you from your customer something is wrong. Customers don't go from seriously considering spending 30K on a bathroom by one person to 5K on the bathroom from another. The only reason that would happen is they believe the 30K bathroom and the 5K one are the same.

Something is not right in your situation. The only time a rebath competitor enters into the scenario with us is if we too are offering to do an inexpensive cosmetic remodel, and it takes about 3 sentences from me for the customer to quickly forget they ever brought them up.

(Sorry....it seems there really are dumb questions)thanks guys for all your posts. I do know one reason that they are thinking about rebath was that the whole time we were designing the bathroom i was dealing with the wife and while they were on vacation. evidently while they were shopping for plumbing fixtures she told the husband that she wanted to live there 5 more years to enjoy the new bathroom. well he had other thoughts and was wanting to move in a year and they didnt think they could get the investment back. i am going to meet with her next week to find out a final decision because we are booked passed christmas and she will be the one that decides and wants us to start next week but knows it is not possible. I have remodeled her daughters whole house almost and so they were waiting to see how the work turned out. they loved our work and then decided to have me look into their bathroom which i need to say is in a $375,000 house. Hopefully things will work out in our best interest. And I have thought about charging design fees but I thought it would scare people away and so I have not done it yet. I end up doing alot of the design by hand then transfer to 3d for a final picture to realize what you would get. Thanks guys for all your help!!!!Oh what the years have taught me in the industry...

Over time you will need to replace those capped over rotten window sills and without removing the wall tile around the tubs and repalce the tub, cover ups fail to repair the damage that exists. It just hides the problem. I believe the products can be designed to do the process well, it just means that the process of covering up has removed the fact that the tub likely had many problems or it would not have been replaced or covered up.
Cover ups can be equated to painting over rust. What is happening under that bright new glossy surface is a cancer is eating away at the very structure that the glossy surface is depending on for stabilty.
If the suface is great and the strutures are good then why not use the lesser intrusive of the two. Buying brand name knock off joggers when purchasing shoes does not mean you will complete a marathon in them..You may need to purchase two or three pair, at the same or above the brands cost.something to bear in mind...what's in the customer's best interest is usually your long term best interest...

by that I mean...this house is approx $375,000...they can spend a couple of thousand on a re-bath and sell the house for $380-385,000 in a year (assuming that the market doesn't drop much more)...or they can spend $30,000 on a complete new bathroom and still sell their house for $385-390,000 in a year or two...which makes more sense?

in addition, if they are staying in the area, you have the possibility of work in their new house.

this whole thing hinges on whether they are selling or not....if they plan on saying, sell your case..but if they are moving, do the right thing...Right now, things get a bit more complex than in a "good" market. 
Depending on how bad they want to move the property, sometimes there is a trade-off between recovering the cost of improvement and "desirability".
One may not recover the total cost on the resale, but it might move faster. 
There are gonna be a lot of houses that sit with the sign out front for a long time.
The bubble has popped, but all the pieces haven't hit the ground just yet.

(Sorry....it seems there really are dumb questions)i use a similiar service now & then to "rejuvinate" thermoplastic panel pool stairs. over the past few yrs zero probs. yet my guy is an owner operator & 
we are on a first name basis. he basically comes out in a "space suit" & sprays the material i pay him about a G.

btw the work is holding up to chemical & ice loads.

ray......Less with the jaw & More with the paw.....When I remodel bathrooms I sell the project as being gutted and starting over getting rid of mold, lead drum traps etc... Re-bath cannot offer that type of project so I would sell them on quality over speed. Someting along the lines of "Well Mrs. HO yes you could cover the tub and walls but you also may be trapping mold and other issues for the next HO possibly with kids to deal with".I worked for a company in san diego back in the 80's that did the tub liner thing and I remember that the biggest problem that they had was water leaking in under the liner either from between the joint where the tub meets the wall or more often around the drain ring. It made the water would set in there and mold would form. I took one out once that that had happened to and boy did it smell. I never messed with that part of the business again.POOLMANinCT said:

I do not think it is the same product, the liners that I have seen are pre moulded ones that kind of fit over the existing tub and cover the wall tile in some cases...I have seen the epoxy spray systems, and that could be a better product.A friend of mine is looking at houses, as he is in the market to upgrade, so when he gets something he might make an offer on he asks me to look at it, he wanted me to look at a house that had one of those rebath things done, it looked like hammered dog crap. I told him to keep looking, the cost of tearing that mess out and re-doing the bathroom right was not worth what they were asking for the house.I may be going to hell in a bucket, but at least I'm enjoying the ride.hey TurnkeyConst is that a marble tile job that You were telling me about?

I'm waiting to see the pics :thumbup:yes it is

So guys that is what I feared for them was the ability to resell with it being done,
and the chance of leaking around the liner and into the tub. I hope that one day
everyone realizes what re-bath does but by then they will be long gone setting up 
into another state.Oh what the years have taught me in the industry...

correct woodmag, it is a spray system not a drop in panel.......Less with the jaw & More with the paw.....and you call yourselves experts?

TO all who have answered this forum with typical prejudiced responses, you give every honest and quality contractor a bad name. It seems to me from afar that most of you really don't understand what re-bath does, how they exactly do it, and what they really use. So how can you run your mouths about it? Is this the same way you approach your costumers when they ask questions? 

I have worked for a re-bath dealer for 6 years. Each location is a franchise. Each location is only as good as it's ownership, but thats true for everyone who posts here too. Re-bath is not hammered crap!

It is more than tub liners. First a liner can only go over a cast iron tub and nothing else. When we remodel a fiberglass or steel, or old ceramic tile job it comes out. We offer any home owner a simple alterative to traditional bathroom remodeling. Less mess ( in general) less time to remodel. 

We use no subs, we extensively train our own people.We always pull required permits when moving/changing drains, or electric is involved. We give a real honest to god lifetime warranty and stand behind it like no other company on earth. Our products are not cheap crappy preformed kits. Almost all work is done completely on site. All measuring, cutting, installing etc. 

We do not sell with high pressure and empty promises, and we put every detail in writing before the client signs anything. We are outstanding members of the BBB, and actually have our entire product line independently tested by Underwriters Laboratories. 


I have worked for four different contractor/remodeling firms in 16 years and have never seen a more professionally run, or better customer centered business. If you are losing bids to re-bath, then look at your approach and products you offer. It's not our fault. We don't compete with high end remodeling, and I have never been able to change a customer's mind that really wanted to do slate, or custom tile work for their bath/shower. So we really don't compete.Hey guys,

A referral is asking me to quote him on gutting his basement and refinishing it completely different. I met with him today to take measurements for Sketchup, so I now have a layout of the basement.

I'm inclined to give him a "ballpark" quote based on what he wants and what I KNOW will be involved. But will also make him aware that once we gut it, once unknown variables now become apparent and must be dealt with. 

It it was a bare basement I would have no problem giving him a solid price. 

Just wondering how you guys would go about this. I have finished a few basements but this is my first gut and finish.

Oshawa deck builderYou need to get some of those see behind wall glasses, every good contractor has a least one pair, some have several pairs int/ext, roof and basment.Still "Shakin" the tree bossYeah sucks especially when a few joists are shot and need to be replaced. Clause will cover you but also mention to Custie verbally a couple of times. I love when they claim " I trusted you so I didn't read the contract" SmhI've done tons of these. Have your electrician and plumber (if there's a bath being added) as well as your HVAC guy do a quick walk through.

The mechanical guys also can't see through walls but can get a pretty good feel by what is showing what to expect. 

So far, ZERO percent of all the basements I've done didn't require a full demo of all mechanicals.

Homeowners and handymen love basements since nobody discovers hackery until it gets torn out.220...221...whatever it takes!There is an existing bathroom which he actually wants torn out and replaced with a wet bar!Aztec Decks

After demo is done, you can clearly see the issues that need to be addressed and you can price that accordingly.
I also get my plumber to make sure everything is vented right, have him use a camera to do under slab sewer line inspection using a camera to make sure there is no leaks, last thing you need is start ripping out tile after completion if there is a problem down the road.

I wouldn't be too concerned about it... A detailed SOW and unforeseen/unknown clause should mitigate any issues you're going to have as it relates to pricing... that, and simply explaining to him in advance and when you submit the proposal that it does not include things that might present themselves as you move forward and just give him an example... we have a spot for them to initial next to the clauses which represent their acknowledgement that it was discussed and they understood...

Most customers aren't jerks about that when it happens... disappointed or frustrated maybe, but they were informed verbally and in writing of the possibility, so hard for them to be mad at you specifically...

Your other option is to break it into two projects... do the demo and then the quote for the rest when everything is exposed...KAP said:

The risk is that you don't get the job, because you quote $100K based on seeing the crumbling foundation, or whatever.

Wood framing is approved. Engineer approved. South Florida Building Code. What are you talking about?Expect the UnexpectedAnyone on here ever experienced putting up 10' panels on a ceiling? If so - I'm curious how exactly you did it and how well it worked. 

I've got an "expert" telling me he just pops them up, by himself, with a little adhesive and nails them in. Is it possible for one man on a ladder to put up a 10' panel on a ceiling? Opinions please...?I think with a cleat at the bottom to keep it from sliding, and it could certainly be done.The thing is it's a 10' panel that's only 1/8" thick. So it's heavy as hell and flimsy. I'm having a lot of trouble holding the entire panel up in place - perfectly flat so the glue can dry. The ceiling is 15-20' up..:blink::whistlingExpect the UnexpectedI do a lot of stupid things solo being I'm a one man show. How thick are these panels?

I'd be more inclined to use scaffolding, it would be safer also. Cleats on the bottom, slide the panel into the cleat, positions, have your nail/screw gun close by, done.Lewis CarpentryRent a drywall lift.META said:

What he said.

Make it easier on yourself!we did a few projects for this lady .
she was a nice lady , but one of those people who could not visualize anything .
we build what she asked for and a couple times she said " oh , I didn`t know it would look like that , we need to change it ."

well , we re-bui9lt 3 cabinets in her kitchen
she hummed and hawed for 3 days while we worked on whether we should just put formica doors , buy new shakes doors , or therma foil,
we did 2 cabinets with Formica.
she decided to leave the last one without doors for now , so knocked off $200 .

now a month later , she calls and wants us to come back and do those doors for $200.
while the tools and materials were there , it would have been 4 or 5 hours to make those doors.
now ,I`d have to go , pick up materials , set up tools , and make these 4 doors.
it`ll kill 2 of us a full day .
do you guys think I have to honor that $200?
I mean I am all about being fair to a client , and being honest.
she was a referral.

she was just so dingy through the job.never making her mind up.
I lost money the first time around .
personally I`d rather just say I`m too busy , and not work there 
but I don`t know if that's fair eitherCan you make the doors offsite, then install?

We're not supposed to talk about cost specifically, but that sounds like a big loser to do it there. Explain the new cost and why, politely. Treat it like a new work ticket, not unfinished business unless you left it that way somehow. You can only do the best you can do (for everyone).

And it also sounds like you offered a month ago at $200, she didn't accept, and that "ship has sailed". Now your situation is different. I don't think there's an obligation to honor that quote under different circumstances.You should have explained to her that if she decided to do the third one later on, it would not be 'just the $200' you knocked off.You know you're old when you can truthfully claim to have spoken with someone born in the 1800's.Maybe, but it's not really the same thing. Knocking off some cost (for something originally agreed to) isn't equivalent to being able to add it later for same money. Who else does that?Spike7 said:

From what you posted, you left her with nothing but the $200 in her head... learning lesson IMHO to make sure if it happens again to remind them that a deferred decision will cost more later and why...

Even if you now charged $400, you have to decide if it's worth souring a link in your referral line... woman talk... especially ones like this...

Personally, if you actually have to do it, I'd push for more money since that was her decision and simply tell her what you told us... "While I was there Ms. Indecision, and had everything set-up, was what I placed the value of the price of the door on... now I have to come back, re-set up, fabricate it on-site, and then hang it, while losing a full-days work for two people and $200 is not going to cover that... you can appreciate that right?"...

At a MINIMUM, include a trip charge...

How you placed a $200 value on the door I think has more to do with not wanting to give her much credit back at the end of it rather than the deduction actually reflect what it would actually cost... and I can't blame you on that considering the circumstances...

That said... Trying to figure out how it takes two guys 4-5 hours to make one door... :blink: if it's just one formica or thermofoil door, rather than take two guys out of commission for a day, a better solution might to be just to order one through a door vendor and drop by after work one night to hang it... 

This way... you keep a link in your referral chain from kinking and don't lose more money in the end than you would by only charging $200 and having two guys lose the day doing it...If it were me the original job would be a done deal .She paid for the work done and agreed upon.
I also have to question why it would take two men a days time to make and hang two formica doors? And why not build them in the shop? I have built thousands of cabinet doors and while I had a full blown cabinets shop still can't figure out you time on this.Why does it even take two men?It sounds like 4 doors. Also, it takes you away from a job that would actually pay, so you lose that money.

I have no idea what making doors takes, but 200 bucks to lose a day at a real job is a big deal. Especially if you have to go back to a wishy washy client. It will eat up at least a day.

I understand that and started out with minimal equipment as most of us probably have.No problem there but I always made sure I had the equipment to do the job correctly before taking it on.
A days work for 2 men to make 2 cabinet doors still seems excessive to me.I could do that myself with hand tools.
My suggestion was really just to make them in the shop/garage and then go to the job and hang them.

If one guy can make two laminate tops on-site and install them the same day, using basic tools and a couple of horses, it's kind of hard envisioning how two guys making two laminate doors is going to take 4-5 hours... it'd be interesting to hear the break-down of that...

If that's really the case, then I would suggest that he's losing money to begin with... for $200 and two guys, when you still have to provide materials and two guys lose the day, IMHO he's just better off ordering the doors and drop by after work to hang it... be cheaper and he wouldn't lose a whole day for two guys...

Kind of a no-brainer in this case...mako1 said:

Custom Cabinets in Hartford County ConnecticutI'd go back and do the job for $200 and make a note to not do this in the future.

A personal story, I did a $100k+ remodel for a couple and it didn't go perfectly but the work was good and, although it took a fair bit longer than I had projected, I stayed on budget. The customer's had asked me to add a built in cabinet to the bar area about a day before I finished trimming out the entire room. I gave them a number but said I wouldn't be able to do it until later as my schedule was totally jammed and there were others who had been waiting patiently.

I tried outsourcing the cab while I played catchup on other jobs but the one guy who could fit it in his schedule ended up cancelling. I emailed to let them know apologize and let them know it would be a bit longer. They flipped and got really pissed, which I understand to some degree. The end result is that I delivered a very expensive and nice project, but burned my bridges over a $3k cabinet change order. I should have just kept my mouth shut.Jaws;1780140 said:

The issue is the $200 doesn't seam lousy to the customer although we know it is.

This is a project not worth doing. Tell her you took the $200 off because she didn't want it done and you can't charge for work you didn't complete. Let her know you'll quote out what it will cost now.Leo G said:

T: 1-289-470-1330Hi guys,
I'm trying to expand my services and provide my customers that don't want to buy a new kitchen with other options. I notice more and more that many would simply like to accessorize or change the way they store household items in their kitchen. For example, I'd like to offer pull out drawers for their existing cabinets that currently have shelves. Or custom pull out drawers for the sink cabinet. Can anybody help me with the pricing?We can't (and won't) tell you what to charge for your products.

It's simple math: cost of materials, labor and overhead plus your target profit. 

That number can vary wildly from one area to another, along with your skillset. You may find that people aren't willing to pay what you need to charge. Only one way to find out...Thanks TinstaaflLots of contractors do this. Investigate companies that manufacture these things and perhaps you can work up a local distributorship. No reason to replace if the cabs are in good shape and still look good.:thumbsup:220...221...whatever it takes!The hardest part of that calculation is nailing down the labor.Mike.

If you're not already a fabricator, shelfgenie.com does this and you can look at their model...

There are so many drawer and specialty manufacturers out there, you could put your own program for your local market...

Best of luck... 8^)There is a guy I see at my hardwood supplier that does this exclusively. Whenever he is there, he is always stocking up on Blum undermounts by the case and sheets of prefinished Baltic birch. 
It says right on his truck $89 ea., with some exceptions (wider/deeper etc.)This all good advice, thanks everyone. I guess I will have to get into it and learn as I go.... $89 is a good starting point; )For you maybe, not for me.....:thumbsup:dustmaker40 said:



This all good advice, thanks everyone. I guess I will have to get into it and learn as I go.... $89 is a good starting point; )

Click to expand...

In most cases, $89 is not going to cover your costs as a business owner... let alone pay you a salary... even if you're direct expenses were about $25 - $30 for materials (Blum glides, ply sides, finishing material and consumables), you'll also have to account for selling the job, fabricating (cut-lists, cutting, gluing, assembly, notching for Blums, sanding and finishing) and installation... and this doesn't take into account your overhead, advertising (yes that market requires advertising), etc...

Not saying it can't be done, but trying to keep the pipeline full of jobs with $89 pull-outs by yourself (and if not just you, a salesperson gets involved, and that's another level of cost) is going to be a difficult row... you'd need at least two jobs a day to make any money and to do that requires A LOT of selling on top of everything else...

If anything, you might want to consider doing maple or matching interior drawers with dovetails so you can charge more ($150-$175/each, which includes consultation, design, fabrication, the actual drawers with Blum under-mounts, and installation)... basically everything else remains the same except the material you are using with the dovetail which has an increased perceived value...

I'd encourage you not to base YOUR prices on what someone else is advertising on their truck... you need to charge what YOU need to charge to be in business and to make the money YOU want to make... even if the guy advertising $89 each on his van above was legit, he might be happy making $40K/year... but if you want to make $75-$100K/ year that metric alone (not allowing for any other business considerations) will make you more expensive by definition...

There was a thread recently where onedaydoors.com came up and they advertise $159 installed on their website... that's not the actual price the consumer pays... :no:

Best of luck.... 8^)This isn't knocking anyone's formula , advice or anything , but in specialty, service related work, that's somewhat custom, if you are good, present yourself well, know what you are doing, and very clean, you can just about charge what you want .

I don't mean it's a license to steal, but it can be a good ride if you are in a good market, and will stick with it and build a clientele.

I own a cabinet shop and have a remodel business it's dedicated to so I'm pretty familiar with pullouts ...if I did pullouts as a specialty I'd have a killer truck or trailer set up and stocked specifically for that work .

My basic start up advice is usually be willing to serve better, work harder, and be even willing to be less profitable(not cheaper ) in order to build a clientele and be able to charge more and work less later.Thanks AGullion, really appreciate your adviceKAP, I read and reread your post, thanksIt's for real man.

Custom Cabinets in Hartford County ConnecticutI'm sure someone has come across this question after doing residential remodels:
I'm converting a slab foundation two car garage into a guest home. The slab was poured right, with a tire stop, and I need to build a sub floor for that area. Which leads me to the next question: Should it be filled in with concrete or wood? 
I know that if I use joists 8" OC and 3/4" plywood, the floor won't be spongy or springy. But can there still be a noticeable difference there? 
I wanted to use wood flooring throughout, not tile. :001_unsure::001_unsure::001_unsure::001_unsure:Done right, I see no problem with the wood framing. I'd install a good vapor barrier, seal everything up tight and make sure I had proper framing, blocking and anchors and go with it.Wood framing gives you the space to run duct work, electric , plumbing..etc Also, is warmer than a slab.Personally I would go with concrete.

It would be my first undertaking of a multi-unit building but I have no doubts that I could take care of it. 

The client has since been screwed by a "makeshift contractor" that stated he could take care of everything and by the hour. Well they bit and have been bitten. So I would like to take on this project and complete it for them, however I didn't want to run down to the permit office and act like I had no idea what I was talking about when it comes to multi-unit duplex's. If anyone has any experience with this and a residential license please let me know.

Clean, clean clean window, wet window with (I forget what, diluted dish soap I think), apply film cut oversized, squeegie it out, then cut in place with new blade.

Greensboro, NCI have been asked to freshen up an old 8x5 powder room currently with tile wainscoting, which is the undesirable part of the room. Plaster walls, tile on mudbed, etc. Floors are fine and would remain (at this point).

We busted the budget on the rest of the house, so I'm entertaining cheaper ideas to deal with this last room. Instead of tear out, I am thinking about gluing bead board over the tile, add a nailer above the top edge, adding a ledge, something like that. Has anyone here done such a thing, or heard of such a plan of attack? Thoughts?I would think you'll run into more issues during the install.
I wouldn't do it, but I'm sure it can be done.

I haven't given this too much thought yet. But probably nothing fancy and not the real thing. Just the vertical look, cutting down 4 x 8 sheets and adding a cap of some sort. If I do this, I'll prep the surface with some sort of primer, then trowel the glue. Base would be glued on, as well.

Using the thinnest sheets, this thing would look beefy, anyway, and I need room behind the toilet for tank clearance (it's against the wall already). The tile projecting is at least 3/4" off the wall.MarkJames said:

Of course, but there are 12" RI's that are more like 11 1/2-1/4. (I just have to figure out which ones they are again.)That wide of a cap (close to 1" difference in wall planes) is going to look clunky. If you don't tear out, you'll need to get the difference down to something manageable.

Before you decide anything, check to see how flat the tile job is, or you could be dealing with a lumpy mess.

Fastest way to do this is skim the tile and put moulding at the step.I did this last summer. 3/8" birch plywood and 1/2" poplar. Coated the tile with Customs multi purpose bonding primer to help with adhesion. I used PL and tapcons to attach it, it worked great.

Find someone with a moulder & have a custom knife made to match the old trim if it's that vital that you get an exact match. Custom knife for my moulder would cost between $75 & 200 depending on the width of the trim.If you are going to try to "shape" it...

Go with Abatron Wood Epox.....not Bondo.

I've repaired some fairly detailed column bases and other trim details with it.

Not 8' though.

If you can find a new profile that's close enough, you can taper the differences so it flows together and isn't noticeable. That's pretty common in renovation - no matter how careful you are, some trim is going to break. 

Restoration, you have to exact match the profile whole length. I haven't had to have a custom set of knives made yet.

That's really good.What method do you use to attach a split block (Top & Bottom) with a fluted split block post to the front of a bottom base column filler?Huh? (I don't understand the question at all)

TomThanks Tom, I will try to explain..

I have a kitchen I'm now working on. Nice kitchen, shipped in. Many pieces must now be cut and fit to the cabinets giving a high end appearance. 

These are decorative pieces....I have a 3" wide cabinet filler (This is a whole boxed filler, 3" wide x 34.5" tall and as deep as the cabinets). It will be installed between two cabinets. 

I must fasten two split decorative blocks, one on top and one on the bottom of this filler, then cut the split fluted piece of trim to fit in between. The fluted piece and the decorative blocks are thick. I would just hate to shoot them in place. But the with of the box cabinet filler will not let me let any tools inside to screw, drill or attach. So I either have to shoot them in place or glue with some sort of mechanical type fastener. I was just wondering what most do on this site.

ThanksGot it.

I'd scuff any finish, construction adhesive and hot glue combo.

Apply construction adhesive, apply hot melt, push in place. The hot melt will hold until the construction adhesive dries.

Columns aren't fluted, but the "trim" pieces were installed as I described.

TomAny of you guys had luck finding a good storm door system for french doors. Have a client that has a leaky french door a couple times a year when wind is right. Imagine that. I checked it over and added a pad and a couple adjustments but did not see that it would make much difference.

thanks, MikeGerkin or ProviaI did a few with Pro Via. If the door is divided light, you can give them the dimensions and locations of the muntins and they will match any cross bars of the door to them. Really is the best storm door and most user friendly storm door I've installed. 


GaryYou can special order the Pella full view doors for double french doors. Not cheap considering its really not a permanent solution.I made a couple, for a French door that onto the hardwood. 
I used 1x4 and plexiglass with the clip on euro hinges so they could pop them off if they wanted to. 
It was cheaper and easier than turning the door into an outswing.

The shower “stall” space is rectangular, approx. 30” x 54”, and is framed in by typical 2x4 construction on three sides, tied to a typical concrete footing and 4” concrete slab (warm climate). I want the side facing the room (54” opening) to be only partially enclosed with a “wing wall” – alongside the showerhead, taking up about ½ of the opening (i.e. approx. 27” wide). If I can construct this “wing wall” with adequate stability, it will be only 7’ tall and will be attached to the studs at the showerhead (left) end and to the floor, but not to the ceiling. Of course, I would like this “wing wall” itself to be as narrow as possible providing maximum width to the shower area itself for showering.

I realize the standard method of construction would be to have the top/right corner of this wall connected either to the ceiling joists above or to an opposite wall. I am looking for the best method to avoid either of these two options, if possible, simply from the standpoint of aesthetics.

I have considered two alternate methods of building the wall: a) using 4” wide (4”x8”x16”) hollow tile (CMU) with appropriately anchored, 5/8” (or larger) rebar – epoxied into holes drilled 4” into the slab -- from the floor up to the 4’ level with 2x4 framing 3’ on top of that, including framing for a “shampoo shelf”, and b) build the entire wall section with 2x4 framing anchoring it with a vertically placed 2” galvanized pipe sunk into a foot of concrete below the slab and running all the way up (7’) to the top 2x4 rail. (The latter (b) would require hammering/chiseling out a hole in the slab and, in effect, pouring a “footing” for the pipe. For the combination CMU/wood method (a), I would anchor a 7’ long 2x4 to the end of the 4’ high CMU block portion to provide the needed stiffness for the remaining 3’ above the CMU portion.)

I hope my description is clear. I am not concerned that either of these methods will produce a wall that will topple in the wind. However, I would not want someone who loses his or her balance to fall into the wall and have it topple over. Any opinions as to the stability that either of these methods will provide? Any suggestions for alternatives?If this is an option, a small return wall will add a lot of strength. This would make the wall an L shape. even as small as an 8" return with shear wall on it would help considerably, and be far easier to build than anchoring a steel pipe into the ground...although that isn't rocket surgery either.concrete! :laughing:Ryan

Decks G+ - Tool news & Reviews​What I did was, roto down a pt plate using 4" wedge anchors then another 2x4 roto'd on top of the pt, attached with 5.5" wedge anchors. then finally another 2x4 nailed on top of that. Then I attached the upright using galvanized 16d nails nailed into the roto'd/ nailed plates. That stiffened the wing wall enough for the height required (4' 6")Use a 1" iron pipe. the pipe should be cut flush with the top of the top plate or better, embedded in the top plate, and project through the sill plate.

If you're on a slab, embed that pipe into the slab. If you are on a wood framed floor, run the pipe to the bottom of the floor joist space and into/through a block between the joists at the bottom.Patriotism is being loyal to your country all the time and your government when it deserves it.

1-Frame it good and clean, nice cuts, screw framing together.
2-sheath with 1/2'' cdx, both sides, use PLP or equal, screw off sheathing. make sure totaly plumb, and level, (obviously)
3-after adhesive has dried, finish off with sheetrock, wonderboard , whatever.

Click here to let Washington know you disagree with the EPA’s RRPI'll third the plywood idea. I did this on a wing wall between a shower and a toilet last year. I ripped the studs a half inch and added 1/2" plywood. I was able to add extra blocking below floor to lag sill plate to floor. You could do the same with wej anchors or (preferred) epoxy anchors.Union Carpenter/Super started my own shop.Greetings. First-time poster.

I have a similar situation. Wall attaches at floor and at right end, rising 6'10" and extends to the left for 5'6". The left end attaches only at the floor rises about 4-1/2 feet before it starts stair-stepping back toward the right-hand wall. It does not attach to the ceiling at any point. I have framed in it 2x4 lumber, with the bottom plate attached to the slab with wedge bolts and liquid nails for good measure. I have added extra framing and interior corner braces like you see on the underside of deck railings as well as 2 6" L-brackets at the two uprights closest to the left end. I plan to dress both sides and the end with 1/2" Durock, using 4x8 pieces on the large surfaces to give me the most continuous uninterrupted support. The whole thing will be covered with 16" square tile. Something that helps is that there will be a bench along the inside that rises 16" and runs 32" from the right wall before it terminates. From previous posts, it sounds like I should be OK. Thoughts? Thanks!Guys, please , you are way overcomplicating this. What you do is build a 3 1/2 inch wide, 30 1/2 inch long L shaped gusset from 3/4 plywood that sits on top of the wall and extends into the wall and connects to blocking in the wall or is kreg screwed to the nearest stud.

With good prep, the sprayed-on product (epoxy?) sure does. As a temporary measure (16 years ago?), we had it done to a bath and pink 4" wall tile, masking off the black bullnose. Still have it.

I'm not so sure about the wipe-on stuff, expect that it looks like slop with the brush strokes.It all depends on what they use and how they use it and then followed by customer care. I actually do tub refinishing as well as bathroom remodels, so I see both sides. The refinishing is basically a cheaper alternative to replacing. If the finish is applied correctly and the client takes care of it the finish can last 10-15 years. 

When you hire someone to refinish a tub just make sure they back up their work with a warranty. If you have someone who doesn't warrant their work then I would say its a sign they know the coating is going to fail. I use a high solids poly and spray it on with a hvlp. If you have someone using other stuff or brushing it on then I would look elsewhere. Epoxies will yellow over time and if they are brushing it on then they most likely got one of those kits from home depot that will end up peeling in a couple months. There is nothing wrong with getting a tub refinished to save time and money, but just make sure they are doing it right or it will just be a waste of time and money.Assuming the finish adheres, why wouldn't they last? I've never sold a tub refinish, but I've installed acrylic and fiberglass tubs, and I'd expect that if someone took the same care with a refinish as they should with a plastic tub, it should last.- BobI have a guy that this is all that he does. He's darn good and I have never had a single complaint. I have been back several years after the fact to many and they look as good as the day he did it.

Alone Eagle Remodeling, LLCHave a Client looking for a bath remodel. Inquired about an electric frosted glass window, said they saw it on some "home show". I remember seeing something a few years ago and then that was it. Basically the window is wired to a circuit, when it's charged it creates a distortion within the glass, hence instant privacy. Problem is I can't find anyone in my area who has used or installed one or if there still available. 

My other question, is it even worth going to the extra trouble of installing something like this. I could just mention curtains and they would say "That's fine"

To answer your question with a bit of info attached; this is a liquid crystal film that is added to the PVB inner layer of a laminated piece of glass. I have ordered and installed this myself on a couple of projects and am looking into it on another in town now. It is quite expensive ($200-400 sq. ft) depending on the particulars. If you are ordering in larger quantities I recomend getting this from over seas, but you will have to be prepared to wait 8-10 weeks sometimes. there are local vendors that do deal in it, but you will pay a premium.I did a few projects with this product.

Actually its the opposite. Electronic glass is laminated (like a car windshield) so when it "breaks" it stays attached. It is also constructed with an electronic film interlayer fused between the glass which holds it together.. And it will still function even if the outside glass is shattered.I thought the liquid would seep out. My bad.PhilBuild18 said:

John, how does the product from Innovative compare to Sage, LTI Smart Glass, View etc.? There is also an aftermarket electrochromic tinting that can be applied called SmartTint.

We have no experience with any of them, but they are interesting. Can you elaborate as to which companies' products didn't measure up? It seems from your posts that you must know a lot about Innovative.Re: Electric Frosted Privacy Glass Window

r a s, I think both Sage & View are great but they only make dynamic glass that TINTS - meaning it gets dark, not private, so you can still see through it. For a bathroom, I wouldn't recommend that. For areas in the house that you want to tint, like a skylight - go for it!

The first time I tried using this type of switchable glass product, I ordered from GlassApps - BIG MISTAKE. The client was upset with the end product, and so was I. It didn't get very private and in a home where the client wants privacy - it fell short. Besides the lack of quality, they were difficult to work with.

I have a lot of good things to say about Innovative  and their privacy glass because they never gave me a reason to go elsewhere. They were actually the 3rd company I tried because I really believe this is such a cool product and people are always impressed by the technology. I'm telling you, this is the future of windows.

I've been happy with their product and so have my clients, plus - the guys over at Innovative are just easy to work with. They're knowledgeable and they really walk you through the process - total soup to nuts customer service

As far as an aftermarket stick-on, I just wouldn't chance it. When film is laminated in glass, its going to be more durable and last longer than a sticker. Glass protects against nicks & scratches. 

This is a luxury, high-tech product- there's no shortcuts. You get what you pay for. The few extra dollars you are going to spend is worth the peace. You don't want to end up with an unhappy customer & a headache - especially when you're trying to impress them. To be honest, just offering switchable glass has gotten me more jobs. The more people hear about it, the more people want it in their own homes and offices.Hello all, my buddy bought a 1948 1-1/2 story house a couple of years ago. The previous home owner started to finish the upstairs attic area. It was all sheetrock, tape and sanded. When I walked through the house with him, I notice a water stain on the subfloor upstairs. Didn't think nothing of it, just figured something was spilled there. Everything was fine until spring time came. On one of the first 60 degree days, he notice water spots on the subfloor upstairs. He called me up and I went to look. There was water coming from the bottom wall plate, the water was about 3"wide by 15" out from the wall in 3 spots. So we cut a hole in the was to access the crawl space and this is what I found. They used batted R-19 insulation on the wall with a 1" foam over the studs, no vapor barrier. The batted insulation was wet on the foam board side and the batted insulation I pull out of the ceiling joist as well, which was R-19 with 1" foam board, no vapor barrier. There is a lot of batted insulation in the crawl space. There are gable end vents for vented with roof vents on the roof as well. The roof is a "hot roof" There is a bath vent wasn't insulated and we put insulated piping on it. Any thoughts as to why there is so much condensation/moisture in the crawl space? Not enough insulation? Thanks for the help!these situations are always tough to figure out. i have had a couple myself. No vapor barrier is probably part of the problem although foam aboard with the joints taped should be a vapor barrier. Warm moist air is getting trapped up there somehow. I once had an unused chimney that we tore off below roofline and i stuffed insulation into the top of it but found that air was still getting up through it. I ended up blowing it full of insulation. Many times after the first year of construction most of the excess moisture due to the work will be gone from the house and the problems stop. Sorry i have no magic answer.Is there any space between the top of the batt insulation and the underside of the roof sheathing?
Are the soffits vented? Any restrictions to the flow of air from the soffits to the gable end vents?Better give a location if you want good input.

Hazarding a guess without enough information, it's possible condensation froze in the fiberglass all winter, and is now thawing out.How about the Windows

Did the Windows have any condensation to speak of? Just curious.

Mike Tatman
www.ftcollinswindows.comMike Tatman
Fort Collins Windows & Doors
www.ftcollinswindows.comThe easiest part is there is so much condensation because water vapor found its way to a cold enough surface to reach dew point, turned into moisture & it sounds like it froze. On the flip side it also could have come in from the outside via ice dam, etc... & ran down the wall

The catch is finding out how said vapor / moisture got there & then you can actually start figuring out the solution.

Here we can only use what the appliance mfg says we can use, there is nothing else. Most of the time cabinets have to be moved.

My name is Mike and I am a new member here.

Ok, so here is the deal I have a stairwell that is already at 36" wide. The prior owner kinda started to work on it I guess but, I reckon he drew a blank. The concrete pouring which is the inside wall to a enclosed attached garage is not even close to being flat or level etc. It even dips in like 4" and is all jagged.
So, my plan which is underway is to inlay 3/4 thick boards into a notch I cut into the concrete. In the deep areas where there is room I will bring boards out to give me the right depth. 
I only need to inlay four strips so, I would guess the wall is 6-8" thick so this should not be an issue. 
In the pictures the first one you will see where the prior owner back in the 70s kinda started shimming out various boards. In the next photo you with see two boards which are now inlayed into the wall for drywall to attach (it will be covered with a moisture barrier prior to drywall).

My reason for doing this is to have an flat one piece wall ceiling to floor on stairwell and to not drop the width below 36" in width. Also, not wanting to create a ledge.

My big question is what material would you choose to inbed the 3/4 boards into the concrete. 
Would you use mortar then let it set up then tapcon the boards in?
Suggestions are appreciated.I'm confused...

You want to notch out the concrete, then install wood blocks to fasten your drywall into. The wood blocks will be flush with the wood framing above the concrete wall, correct? 

If this is correct, I think I would just use pl to attach pressure treated wood blocks to the cavities in the wall, and fasten with tap cons. I think a nail shot in with a PAT would split the wood in this situation. 

Ideally, I would run 1x4 strapping all the way down, but that would decrease your width by 3/4". 

I'm not sure with exterior walls, but on interior walls, say against a masonry chimney, I've thrown globs of AP compound between drywall and masonry to flatten and adhere the drywall. Usually this is done in sort of a cantilever fashion, so most of the board is getting screwed into wood and the last few feet glued. 

Hope I helped


GaryGbruzze, yes to your first question . 
Using pressure treated is a good idea but, its extremely hard to just tapconn in the boards and get the exact depth and flatness needed that's why I wanted to inbed them in like mortar to give the back of the board a flat surface that is true and level. Notching the concrete isn't easy and without a bedding behind the board they would not set up level etc. I don't think.
Strapping\Firring out the wall is not an option as far as looks IMHO. It would create a step out near the door vertically where it is already rocked etc.
So, with agreement on using treated blocks what would you bed the blocks with prior to attaching to concrete with tapsons etc.Non-shrink grout. I might make a gauge block and set the grout first, then install the wood when it's dry

That wall has never been moist or damp and I doubt it ever will be. It is not an outdoor facing foundation wall. 
I was going to use mortar but to get it thin enough to fill behind the board made it so hard to use effectively. My thinking is it would not have made a difference as the mortar is also capable of absorbing water just like concrete if moisture was issue.
It was ONLY used as a leveler behind the board (very little) and to hold the board temporarily until Tapcons where installed.
If there is ever enough water coming into that area to effect anything there is much more to worry about then that wall. LOLCan you use two different thicknesses of laminate? I.E. .044 on the top, and maybe a .027 on the edges?

Thank youYes. 
Best to do the sides first, then the front, then the top.
This will hide the joints and seal the top of the counter.You can but I never have .I buy my laminate in 30 " widths so the rips cover the backsplash and edges.tucnasam said:

I had to special order some laminate for a commercial job. It's just a white but a bit thicker and higher quality. If for some reason I ran out and had to go get the cheaper stuff from the home depot to finish the project, which happens to be thinner stuff. I'm certain I ordered too much though so i'm ok. It's worth the 15% restocking fee if I return whats unused to have it on hand.tucnasam said:

If it's leftovers you've already paid for... no reason NOT to use it...You're right, but I don't want to store it. Space is limited for me. I'll pay $9.00 to not have to look at it again and keep my mini shop clean and clear. 

I still have the budget for it as well.If you're mixing, the color might not match up. White isn't always white.Whip out some circles to stick on the face of your tape measure. Great for writing down measurements, then wipe off with your finger to erase. Super handy.

I need a few more, but very rarely do laminate anymore. When I do, it's never a pattern/ color that works well as a note thingamajig.

No not reused. I too have removed mirrors that were just attached with gobs of mastic. Some cases you can get lucky and the paper on the rock or bond releases without popping the mirror, other times.......

Naturally we will tape for safety...but I was wondering about Goo Gone or something that can be sprayed and soaked.

Also so on wiki the use of a thin wire wrapped around the window slid down the back side in a sawing motion. Sounds like a long shot but clever.I use 2 suction cups from HD or some other type the go for $6 or so and rock the mirror right off the wall...

It's OK if you're only flossing...Cover them with Grace Ice and Water shield and get the glass started with a flat bar, then just pull it off the wall. Removing glass with Grace on it makes for a ultra fast removal. Almost all of the glass will remain stuck to the grace so the mess is minimal. The Grace allows the broken glass to pretty much retain its shape and it will stay semi rigid making for easy transport to the dumpster.Shims and suction cups. I like the better suction cups. But a handle on a two cup works good,too. A two cup gives you some insurance if one cup breaks loose. And two guys.

tTke your time. Get a few shims going near each other. You'll hear the drywall slowly ripping. Add more shims and just keep slowly working them.I did this when someone offered me free mirrors for a karate school I was building. 

Wear heavy gloves and two layers of clothing. I stood on a ladder so that my chest was even with the top of the mirror. Start at the top by prying away from the wall so the glass starts to flex and hold it with steady pressure when you feel it is starting to reach a snapping point. Hold it...hold it... Eventually, the mastic will pop (you will hear the subtle ripping that will signal you're making progress, a sound like peeling your sweaty leg off cheap vinyl seats) 

You are tearing the top layer of drywall paper off of the gypsum. Pry and hold further until you feel the next level pop. Rinse and repeat. When you get close to the bottom, get ready to support the entire weight of the glass, because it will drop after the last mastic circle has let go, unless it is supported by a J channel.

I was left with (8) 4 x 7 full panels of mirror, broke none of them. There were globs of mastic stuck to the back, but I just reattached it with new mastic is separate spots. Now transporting them was an entirely different story!

I used to do it that way with good suction cups until my glass guy showed me his scars on his arms from a mirror breaking. He now wears kevlar sleeves and a full mask. 

He told me to just use wedges if possible and listen for the paper tearing. If it tears then use the cups, if no tearing call himCall a glass sub!!!

https://www.facebook.com/Superseal-Construction-162699413750013/I've heard differing arguments about this from different contractors. I know it's a definite yes if I'm ripping the original siding but the homeowner only wants a layover existing cedar shingles. I wouldn't think that "changes the thermal envelope" which I believe is the term they use in requiring a permit. Any mass guys in here can tell me for sure? The homeowner wishes to save every dime possible.YesSeriously?

Siding over old cedar shingles? Never seen that done before.It can be done with 1/4-1/2 inch foam overlay. Not a perfect solution, but it will work.kind of what fanfold is for. Depends to on the type of shingles too, siding ones or more thicker roofing ones , on how it will look when done,Jlhaslip, you'd be surprised how often it's done like that out here like vinyl hanger said, with the foam board. This is the first time someone has requested this since my going on my own hence the op. I told him if it's my house I strip and start new but that's gonna be an additional 100/sq plus disposal. He wants to save whatever he can. Still think it's stupid I gotta pull a permit for this. Pretty soon they're gonna want permits for paint.We went over cedar all the time when i did siding in the 90's. Still see guys doing it around here

Once again this is the reason for fanfold under it , give you a flat surface to side on . And yes longer nails, when use to use nails it was 2 1/2 roofing nails that got used. You would be surprised how good it would look if done right. I would not side over the rough thick butt shingles though. Those would get pulled no matter what.good sider will know how to put anything over anything..should he?that's the question and is where experience comes inTomTom Struble said:

Second this. Also, lock washers may have to be replaced after taking things apart. 

If you have to torque a connection to spec, I'd go lock washer. I can't think of a case where I've had to do that, normally it would be threadlocker if you have to torque.Another option:
Star washers, they take less torque to cause the back pressure on the threads and can be reused. But it depends on the application. If I were building a jig or using it on a tool, I'd use a star washer. I'f I need a ton of torque for a permanent installation (like behind a wall), I'd use a lock washer. Something I didn't want to rattle loose over time, a nylock will workDepends on the application. If it's subject to vibration, then Loctite or lock nut is best.tipitop;2814937 said:

I have found that in my area payment terms are :

residential: immediately
commercial: net 30 days
Bank work: up to 90 day

But in all honesty, it boils down to size of work, length of job. Most of my work is finished same day/week.www.callbathdoctor.comI typically do mine in thirds. 
very rarely do I do T&M, but when I do I bill out thurs night with invoice due the next day.
Some jobs like drywall I charge in phases. (downpayement, hang, finish, paint, etc) They get a bill after every phase is completed and inspected. 
That all being said I am very flexable and work with client needs. Long as I get paid at somepoint i really dont care, all goes to the wife anyway! LOLWith homeowners--on a remodeling job--

Project doesn't get on the schedule until we receive a signed copy of the proposal and deposit check.

The day the permit is onsite another payment is due. Then a draw after each inspection passes.

The final payment, due after the final inspection passes,is usually under $1k.

Change order payment are due when the CO is signed and before the work is started.

www.southernyankeehomeservices.comI generally break mine down into 6-8 payments based on completion markers. The amount of the payment is generated by having the client pre pay for the next phase of construction. The first payment is enough to cover ALL expenses to get to the next phase, and so on.

one of the apartments in a 9 unit building, had the plaster ceiling come loose.
about a 4 x 6 foot section actually fell.
I looked at a couple units yesterday.
they actually look fine . not loose.
one did have a few hair-line cracks
they want me to , just for peace of mind , secure all the ceilings better.
they said the one unit that came loose was fixed by a hack , and apparently he just installed drywall over the whole ceiling .
he must not have used the right size screws , so he just made the issure worse( cant pursue him , this was years back)

so I want to go in , and re-fasten whats there if I can ,
of course if they are bad I can remove and install new.

but I realty don`t want to that route if I don`t have to.
it would mea n re-locating tenants , or work trying to work with them there .,
units are about 800-1000sq. ft. each
removing all the plaster would be a mess.and pretty costly 

other ideas to re-faster plaster? or would the screws just blow through?

its the old plaster , and lathe i believe.

or should I drywall on top , and make sure screws are long enough?

just want to do this the easiest , cleanest way.but one where I don`t end up liableYes there's a way. 

There was a real good JLC article about it a few years ago. It might have been by Myron Ferguson, might not. 

I believe the author injected epoxy into bad spots, as well as lots of screws with plaster washers. 

Here's a link to another JLC article on the topic, but not the one I was thinking of.

I did watch the this old house one ,

looks pretty good, 
I wonder if it will still work if the plaster is not on wood lathe, and is just installed onto 1x4`s

also , I just want to make sure it works like they say .
,
their way , I`m totally relying on the product to hold it , 
I was hoping I could have some way of a screw of fastener , going into the studs to hold it 

I`m going to be responsible for this ,
much different on the ceiling as opposed to a wall repair.

I will check the other articles. and the product reviews 

any other ideas?I would look at using the plaster washers too. 
Can you push up on the ceilings and feel any movement? If so determine how big of an area is loose. I would then consider removing any large loose patch and clean out between the lath, apply a bonding agent to the lath, then apply one heavy layer Structolite Basecoat, finish just shy of finished surface. once dry (min 24 hrs) and then finish it. The Basecoat will form new keys and bond to the old lath. 

If no loose areas and just securing for peace of mind then plaster washers would be a way to go, run screws into joists as much as possible. Then skim coat the ceiling. 

I am not a fan of just putting drywall over plaster ceilings, just adding weight if not done right, and frankly I think it is more work.I've tried doing this in the past (20 yrs ago?) on my wifes parents garage. It was a pain to say the least. If I were to do it today, I would counter bore for about a 1.25" fender washer, & size the washer center hole so the 2.5" dw bugle head screw barely grabs the washer center. What you end up with is a huge bearing support area, and an easy to finish surface patch. A 1/8" deep counter bore should be plenty.By the time you go to all the trouble of halfazzing this repair, you probably could have done it right for just a little bit more. And we wonder why modern buildings rot to the ground.

This is the kind of job that I quit taking a long long time ago. It always come back to b bite you and regardless of how much you tell the client about the job, he thinks it's your fault.

totally don`t agree ,

it has to be done ,someone will need to do it .
so , even if it ends up I have to remove all the plaster and re-do it , they`ll have me do it.
I understand your theory.

but I have forever clients who stick by me , because I will research the hell out of it , and find a solution .
I`m 57 .and still not afraid to ask " how do you hang a door" , even though I`ve hung them since I was 16 with my dad.
" here`s how we lay out for our framing , decking "
how do you do it?
maybe you have only tried your way, and never thought : theres a better way out there"

this isn`t ground breaking , or the first time this has happened , ever .
its been done thousands of times before across the U.S.
so there is a solution.

look at it your way ,
but ,maybe you don`t like call around or researching , because maybe someone will think you don`t know what your talking about .
. that`s an ego/pride thing.

I am getting very few responses , 

kind of surprised!

no one has told me anything , except the " this old house video)
and the one about the " plaster washers".

and I have ordered the plaster washers mentioned by one of the responders.
,, and I`m going to try them out today ( first day of this project)

gonna locate the studs , or nailers , and chaulk them out , and run screws all along them.When it's plaster on lath,

You can find wood and put washered fasteners in, which helps.


However, also true if it's old plaster on lath,
It's pre-1978, which means high probability of lead and asbestos.

IF: You find the framing wood and get that marked out, then install drywall over top and make sure you get into the framing, then you avoid exposing yourself and tenants to hazardous materials.

That to me would bear greatly on my decision.fourcornerhome said:

That's the same junk they used to put in the projects around me for partition walls within the apartments. That's a job I wouldn't touch unless I could reframe with wood or steel and hang new drywall. 

If you're set up for it and it suits your skill set, I'm sure you could repeat the same thing. Wire mesh tie wires to the steel "studs", scratch coat, brown coat, finish coat. 

Good luck, keep updated on how you handle this.

This is more common only in wet areas such as bathrooms- Dry areas generally did not get the metal mesh backer (though I have seen it elsewhere.) The metal mesh was done only for tiled areas, as the extra strength was needed to evenly distribute the weight of the tiles. Very very common to find it around my parts, for any bathroom that was renovated through the 80's. And it is RARE for those to come apart. You'll find this stuff lasting for at least a few decades.

For your ceiling, usually they fail due to either vibration, joist deflection, which end up cracking the keys off. Water damage was also common, where the wood slats would swell and crack the keys. 

The prescribed procedures above will help, epoxy injection will bond to the wood again. on a horozontal service, you will have more difficulty, as debris can move inbetween the plaster and the lats preventing you from securing it back in place.

A new sheet of sheet rock will only be a temporary fix- the weight of plaster is heavy, and if they come loose, they will all fall. I'd knock out the sections, and just replaster. It looks better in classic old homes than replacing everything with "sheet rock".Yes all of this stuff is gone and I have put up steel studs and drywall and will be using densheild when I am ready to tile but what to use to replace all of the old plaster that has fallen off in other rooms? sheet rock 90? Will 90 stick to the base that looks like a sandy cementCoat with plaster weld then structolite 


Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkWhich way would you go on this?

For an upcoming "partial" bathroom remodel, I am replacing a one-piece tub/shower fiberglass enclosure with an acrylic alcove tub + tile. The floor is in perfect shape and current style they want. Our original plan was to save it and set the tub into the alcove footprint, right up to the tile edge (straight, no curves) and go from there. 

Now that I have the enclosure removed, I've actually got 33", front-to-back in the alcove, not 32". (And 14-2 on the stud faces that are jusst passing through to other rooms, nice  ) Lucky I was careful with the recip saw on the removal.)

Anyway, I go back and forth on this, but considering what's easier to do, would you:
A: fur out the alcove to set the tub, or
B: push owner to redo the floor?

Btw, the alcove cab is to remain, as well. (That's getting a new top and fixtures, only.) 

Which way to proceed? I've never set a tub up to existing floor, but it seems like it would simple. Yes, no?Wouldn't be a big deal to fur out, and a lot cheaper. Set the tub and then fur. Assumes the floor is square to the new tub set.
How did you get so lucky on the 14-2?? I cut it when that happened to me.goneelkn said:

Good day to buy a lottery ticket!!:thumbup:

Even if the floor isn't square out, you could fur a little more and cut the floor where needed.I'd say you actually have a better chance of being able to place it just right with a little furring work than if it was an exact fit like you thought.

New tile would be a nice upsell, but certainly no more necessary than it was before you discovered the extra space.We have furred and also trimed out at the floor or added a boarder. 

The up sell is always thought 1 though.Superior Remodeling Solutions

I'm going to a house now that wants 12 casement windows replaced with Anderson 400 series. I'm reluctant to go give an estimate because I am not familiar with casement windows. Will they come out like double hung leaving a casing for the insert? Or do they come out to the rough openings only? Much obligedTo replace casements with 400 series you need to remove it all.
The 400 series is not a replacement window ,Replacing the whole window IMO is a much better way to go if you can. A little more cost and work , but looks nicer I think and can be sealed up better.Framer53 said:

I've put in the 200 insert into a Anderson narrowline, but have never seen a 400 upgrade. 

The op wants to remove the glass from the casement and install a double hung replacement? 

That won't work at all right? You gotta go new construction , pull the exterior cladding yank the casement , flash opening , install Anderson 400 new construction.

I guess you could install an insert, but you'd probably have to butcher the frame , add stops , cap outside , 
Seems like an excessive amount of work.I have put tilt pack 400 in an old Narrow line but not with casements. It would depend on the type of existing casement and how the sills work out. I can't see how the sill would work. 
Never did package inserts. Woodwright has them and Renewal by Anderson sold a 100 or 200. I see them in the book but they don't show going from one style to another.Ohteah said:

i was just saying there is a 400,i didn't say whether it's worth it or not,the stops on a andersen casement are easy to remove

as to new construction or insert the condition of the existing frame will usually tell you a lot as far as additional flashing

imo the differences in sizes from on type of unit to another would be another issue to look atTomcasements are never bigger than 36 wide. You'll get a small window once you install a replacement in the existing frame. easy, remove sash and 4 pieces of trim. cap the exterior. or like everything else pull the whole unit out and put in new. Doesn't matter what dh u use.I am familiar with the Andersen 400 series and do not remember there being any similarity in a DH vertical slide to a casement.

The hardware is a completely different animal you can see that when you look at a casements handle locations and sash operation.

You will have to remove the existing windows and install new windows.

In Andersen AW you can change only the same type of sashes and they must be the same model / make only.

I've got two bathrooms in a commercial building that needs it brought into ADA code. Soap dispensers, grab bars are to high, etc.

Because of this I'll have patching and painting to do.

I'll be moving the grab bars around the toilet down two inches. Since there will be holes in the FRP I would think the only option is to pull FRP and replace. No way to patch it i assume.

I've never dealt with FRP but from my research, I'll be replacing the drywall behind it as well.

And now that I am thinking about it. They did FRP then installed toilet... So that may be two peices and a trim to get around the pipes...

Any input would be great. Working on my bid now. Customer is Peir One imports.

Ianfrp is pretty thin and somewhat fragile.They like it in those applications because it cleans easily.Definetly needs a backer of some kind.There are trim pieces to go between the sheets as well as premade corners.It glues on.
As a side note you will probably need a vinyl base to meet code.Generally bathrooms require 6" base now alsoWhy not put buttons in the holes?

The key in working with them is to not under price your bid. if you need more help PM me.Can you glue new frp to the old frp?Pretty tough to glue over existing with the plastic trim....Cut the plastic of first.Mike.
_______________I think the first easy fix would be to install the plastic plugs in the holes. While not a pretty fix, it is very possible they aren't interested in having it perfect. Especially if it is for employees.

If you start tearing out FRP panels, you will be getting into alot of work. They may not want to spend that much.How about a metal fabricated plate to cover the old holes and include the new? Get it finished in brushed aluminum or powder coated.

What are you referring to when you talk about the pipes?Bid it to replace. Its just sheet goods. An experienced frp guy could do a whole new bathroom in less then two hours. Replacing a panel or two should take you the same. Especially if you have gyp to patch.

Once you get your hands on it, it will peel off the wall. Small wide flat bar or wide scraper and work your way down prying if it gets stubborn.PhilA heat gun would also help.

water table. oops superseal beat me too it.Could be something weird.

I'm tending to an old house that does not get water through some very porous walls or from rain or snow. But if you use the back outside faucet water shows up 15 feet away in the middle of the basement. It's just the way the water hits and there must be an underground vein open.P.S By the way, if this is an old house built in the early 20s or something around that, they did some basements just doing a so called "rat slab", it would show wet spots just from the dirt under it, moisture will bleed right through the slab... seen that not one occasion in older homes.I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​superseal said:

I've seen many cases that manifest themselves in the same spot. There could be a tear in a vapor barrier if in place as well. Regardless, it sounds as though hydrostatic pressure of some sort, is working it's magic. 

You could drill a couple of holes around the slab and get a sense of soil moisture...just fill with a hydraulic water plug when complete.

I have demo'ed plenty of mudbeds and know exactly how well they hold up. The effort, time and draw back concerning the height make it obsolete.

And we sure as hell know that these new methods hold up. They too have been around for decades. Ditra and Kerdi Membrane have been around since 1987, nearly 3 decades.Tried & True on Facebook

Your not pouring SLC over planks, you must be using something else like another layer of plywood first. Then your sanding plywood treating seams, priming, damming off before pouring, then topping again with your choice of isolation. Sounds like more time past doing this and height.....whats the difference maybe 1/4"?. (Thicker ply and ditra vrs thinner ply & mud)Tom M said:

I think there are much better ways to do it. But better in the since that you can yield the same result without the effort and drawbacks of a mud floor.

You and I both going to have to add plywood. So no gain or loss, but after that I'm only going to add another 1/4" before tiling. A mud floor is going to be at least an inch thick. I've never torn out one that was less. So you are at least 3/4" higher. 

On the rear occasion that a floor is in need of correction my overall time may be close to yours but my floor thickness is still at least a 1/2" thinner. I rarely have a floor so bad as to require adjustment. Most can be handled with thinset while you are setting.

But I can also just plywood and then aqua defense. That would add no additional height.

Plus, all of my methods can have me tiling the same day. I also have the advantage that my floor is fixed and finished before installing the tub.Tried & True on Facebook

Click to expand...What is your 1/4" on the ply? the ditra? You dont wait a day before topping it? I knew what method you were going to put out. At the end of the day I just still prefer the mud.I was taught to never tile a floor with less than an 1" under it, other wise there is to much room for deflection. I'd be putting a layer of 1/4" ply over the floor boards, glued and nailed every 4" with ring shank nails, locate the low spots, fill with thinset, use a large notched trowel to butter the ply, lay the Backer board and screw it off to spec.Another horrible idea in my eyes is gluing the plywood.

Why does gluing the ply give them problems? If anything they would be thanking you for reducing their squeak's and giving them a solid floor.I'm installing plastic laminate between uppers and lowers, my favorite job, not. I have always used contact cement and wax paper, but just talked to a guy who said he has used tile mastic for years and never had a problem. Has anyone else done this or know of an easier way than contact adhesive.FRP adhesive might work better than tile mastic---I have never stuck laminate to a wall--but i have put up plenty of FRP---

Some FRP glues are better than others--you will want the solvent based--Using other than contact cements, have to watch distorting from uneven layers, globs and such more so than with it. There are a couple solvent based mastic that are problematic. They actually distort the laminate with uneven coverage. Unlikely you'll use those, just be aware.

Vertical grade laminate will telegraph imperfections in adhesive application, like every time. Horizontal or standard grade is much better, but not perfect. Even different brands work better than others. Formica, aborite horizontal grades, as examples, are thicker and much less likely to give problems.

.... and in many cases, customers, bid prices on projects, all the above don't mean nothing and mastics work just fineJaja Wazak always said nothing good ever come from CanadaI installed the laminate on the wall this afternoon with mastic using an 1/8 inch V notch trowel. Seemed to grab well and was able to adjust it on the wall. Hopefully it is still stuck in the morning and twenty years from now.Update. went to my job the next morning after applying my laminate with mastic. if I wasn't a grown man i would have cried. All curled up, about half stuck half not. So I peeled it off, some paper came with part of it. I scraped, sanded and wiped the laminate. I scraped the wall and proceeded to do it the right way with contact cement. 7 hours later I am back to where I started. That's what i get for trying to do something the easier way. I am thankful that I could save the material, not so much the cost but the time it would have taken to get more up here in the sticks.Sorry it fell off---we applied FRP over ceramic tile----with both surfaces being air tight---no water based adhesive would hold---we ended up using a really nasty solvent based---

The first bathroom took 3 tries before we found an adhesive that would hold.

The project involved 32 bathrooms----so experimenting was worth while.mike gunderson said:

That sucks... sorry to hear it...

Next time (if you can get over the mental side of it and actually want to do it again) try 3M-90 and a roller... just make sure you do your test fit first to find any high spots (and address first) and that it's a good fit all the way across as the adhesion is pretty strong so you are better of sticking it in the corner first and rolling across using the counter or splash as a guide so no adjusting necessary...i haven't put laminate on the wall above the counter top in twenty years but used to do it all the time on kitchen remodels. We just used liquid nails and never had a problem or call back. I still see some of these kitchens to day and the laminate is still stuck.We used to try to put it up after the base cabinets but before the walls and counter top so that it went under the wall cabinets and back splash. 
now its all tile work

nicko"Quality work for those who know the difference"I started my cabinet work sharing a shop with a guy who built laminate furniture for banks, loan companies and check cashing businesses. I got into this conversation with him one day and he told me that he would NEVER use anything but contact cement on laminate and gave me a 15 minutes explanation which I don't remember. This guy was in the business for 30 years so I believed him. 

I will say this, though. I build mostly just kitchens and bathrooms and when I'm doing a tile backsplash I no longer use thin set. I use LocTite PL375 in a caulk gun. I FLY through the installation a lot quicker. If it's a mosaic I just apply the LocTite straight on the wall and use a 3/16 V notch trowel and spread it out. 

I keep a heat gun handy so I can dry any tiles that I've had to cut on my wet saw.I'm in the process of doing some work at my own house.. Work was a little slow so I let a couple of my guys tear into my bathroom.. I have a built in bathtub it had framing in the front of it which then had tile installed on it. The framing served no purpose other than hiding the front of the tub. I'm wanting to get a marble slab for the front of the tub, but I'm wondering how I should go about setting it the slab?

Hoping someone could offer some advice? 

My preference would be to do away with the framing as I think it would look better to just use one piece instead of using a vertical piece of marble with a capped marble piece on that. I planned to just put in a small block at the bottom and then using some silicone to stick the slab to the tub and to this block.. I like the thought of this better than putting a slab onto the framing and then using another small piece to sort of cap the top of that.. But I have concerns about it being enough to really hold it good.. 

Is it doable to put it up without the framing like I want, or should I do it onto the framing? If you think it's better to attach to the framing should I use some durrock and mortar it, silicone it to the studs or?? If you think I an do away with the framing; how should I stick it up there? 

Any help would be appreciated.. Please excuse the mess.. ThanksHardwood Flooring MN

If so cut the slab to rough framing size.
Install slab against tub then run the drywall to the slab from each end wall.
The drywall on either end will keep the slab in place.

Thanks for the reply. I appreciate it. We do have access from the opposite side of what is shown via a door in the next room over, we also have access to the front of it through a closet thats right next to it.. So one way or another we can get to the motor and more crucial parts.. 

My brother use to own a bathtub refinishing company, so we are planning to paint the tub white when everything else is done. 

Also, we were planning to tile down the sides where you mentioned drywalling, but using the method you mentioned of locking it in there would be doable with those tile.. I can just stick it up there with silicone as I mentioned, then tile down the sides and purposely kind of lock it in with the tiles also helping to hold it.. 

Thanks for the tip.Hardwood Flooring MN 
Hardwood Flooring Minneapolisyou need something to support the lip of the tub, whether that's the new 'slab' or the existing frame with tile that you will replace 

when you say a 'slab' of marble, what does that mean? may look nice to put up some wood panels then cap with the white tiles on the frame you have now. depends on what kind of marble you have as to how it will look. if it's truly a single piece, silicon/adhesive on the vertical 2x4's and install and it will be fine.

Thanks a lot for the reply. I appreciate it. When I say a slab I am referring to a single piece of 1" thick X 69" long X 18" wide carrara marble. I actually just picked that up today.. When planning for this project I was initially going back and forth between a solid slab, or doing it with a wainscoting look, I think that's what you were referring to.. I ultimately decided to drop the money on the big slab cause in the end I think it will have a better overall look.. 

After seeing and carrying the slab today, I would agree with you.. Their is no way that after carrying this thing that I'd be comfortable with just sicking it to the bottom board and to the tub.. I'd be afraid that I'd be sitting on the pot and then have the thing fall on my feet. LOL. 

I'm gonna try to make as much framing as I can and then try to have it both screwed into the floor and to the walls on the sides and then I'll use some adhesive in every possible place, then I'm gonna put in the side tiles and have them further lock it in, and then after putting it up there I'm gonna use some clear silicone to silicone the seam between the slab and the tub to both further help hold it and to protect it from water getting in there.. 

Again, I appreciate the reply but since it's been a few days since I posted this question and I have since carried it, I have figured out that I'll have to do just as you said with the framing.. Thanks again!Hardwood Flooring MN 
Hardwood Flooring MinneapolisReplaced roof for customer little over a year ago. Now their having brown streaks coming down walls in a couple places only in the last couple weeks while its been pretty cold.

Cleaned it off and it came back in a time where it never made it above 20 degrees, north side of the roof shouldn't be a lot of heat loss. There is currently snow on the roof.

Streaks where there in the roughly the same spots prior to the roof being replaced, they had dealt with a lot of condensation issues in the past as its a addition sunroom theres only baseboard heat and not a ton of airflow.

True vaulted ceilings with bat insulation, vent chutes between insulation and roof decking throughout most of the room.

in the pictures the streaks are near the flat side of the chimney, that of corse would lead me to look at the chimney, however the flashing has grace ice and water underneath lapping up the sides and the flashing is impeccable. The vent chutes only run on the right side of the chimney to the ridge.

Any ideas where this all could be coming from? I refuse to redo the roof work at this point since everything was redone and there wasnt a sign of a leak on that side originally (streaking was on the walls prior to roof replacement)

I originally said condensation but this streaking is from a couple days only as he cleaned it off and seems to only be in that spot.

Any and all constructive theories welcome.My guess would be a lack of ventilation in the Cathedral. 
I appreciate that the insulation stops are there on their lower end, but what about the top end? Or possibly the insulation got pushed up and is restricting air flow up that rafter bay.
A solution I have used is to cross strap the rafters with 1 x 4's so the venting can go sideways if it gets plugged.

*edit*
Just noticed the skylight in the second picture.Would this be the wall that is streaking? If so, definitely you need to cross strap that roof since the skylight won't allow proper venting.Since it is near the chimney, I'm guessing it is condensation from that area. Not a leak, just poor insulation around the chimney.The issue is directly above the small side of the chimney, parallel to the skylight. Chimney is unused. There are vent cutes in 2-3 spaces on both sides of skylights, and up to and above skylights obviously that doesnt do much but theres no issue there. Opposite side is basicly the same except without a chimney, had one small streak on that side and a few other small streaks around windows etc on walls but nothing like the ones pictured.
Homeowner thinks we are trying to deny roof leak and doesnt buy the condensation angle. My question now would be is it really feasible to have that much come from condensation above the ceiling.

Also the ceiling is tongue and grove wood stained brown.There's insulation, but is there any vapour barrier and air sealing? Penetrations, especially a fire rated assembly like a chimney, are notoriously difficult to detail around on a cathedral ceiling. 
If the staining correlates to rain, or a big thaw of the snow, it would seem to be a leak though. 
Is there a bathroom vent or anything close that might be venting into the attic/soffit? moist air from shower gets pumped into the attic, condenses/freezes on the closest cold surface. Warms up a little then turns to water and runs down? I've seen this one before, where whoever put the vent in, didn't pipe it to a soffit vent, just basically ran the pipe just shy of the soffit area...all the sheathing and drywall rotted away.Have you run a leak test? Gone up in the attic to trace the condensation/source area?

With it presenting itself with the snow on the roof, that would seem to indicate a leak of some sorts...

That's seems to be a lot of pass-through with discoloring to be just simple condensation IMHO...

Since this has happened before and is now happening again, there should be water stains in the attic (if not a little mold) to lead you to the source...Ridgeliner said:

Click to expand...

And there are no vent chutes in that exact area, right? It does sound like a condensation issue, though that looks like a lot of water for such a small area.

I once fixed a similar issue on a much larger roof. It only showed up when we had an extended period of bitter cold weather. Turned out that though there were vent chutes in place, the installers had butted them tight to the backside of the fascia--so they were choked off and getting no air flow.

Pulled the soffit and cut them all back a few inches, and they've never had the problem since.Got a closer photo of the valley/chimney flashing?Trump-The "Con Man's" Con Man.Since this was done last year, a roof leak would have shown up a long time ago. Unless they are trying to say it just started.

I'm still going with condensation. Hot humid air getting into the cold attic.

Just yesterday a homeowner asked me to look for a leak above a bathroom vent fan. Instantly I thought condensation. We were there all morning. Probably dripped enough to fill a 44oz soda cup. Fixed the insulation before lunch. 12 to 2, no drips at all.I put my money on condensation running off the roof on the inside. happens alot more than we'd like to believe, just most of the time it never builds up that much. 

Mostly its from hot air getting up in there. No amount of soffits helped in my situation. It was the in wall AC units that leaked, through a non well sealed attic opening.My chips are on the chimney...you say it's unused?...Looks like a fireplace flue, which probably contains creosote, which is leaching due to saturation and/or condensation issues within the flue itself. Those stains appear to be beyond just water and ordinary building materials. 

Warm air can escape through the throat/loose damper, etc...and condense on the smooth terracotta flues and within the solid masonry itself through gaps at the flues. Capillary action from exterior water penetration is more than likely at play here as well. Masonry dries out much slower in the winter and the balance of moisture content can be thrown off dramatically.

I'd pop the cap off that chimney and peer down as well as inspect the firebox on up. Get some close up pics of the chimney on all sides and good shots of the flashing. The chase cover should have diagonal creases for drainage and should overlap the masonry by 2" min."Under promise, over deliver and all that!" JBM

'It takes considerable knowledge just to realize the extent of your own ignorance.'-Thomas SowellNo doubt in my mind that it is a condensation/ ventilation issue.
I see it a lot in the winter. The colder it gets the more calls I get.
Warm humid air is getting into the rafter spaces and for whatever reason is not venting out properly.
For starters have them turn off any humidifiers. Then try to find out if there is adequate airflow and try to seal up any openings where the warm air is getting through.

Is it possible that the chimney liner is cracked?Your Dreams won't work unless you do.​Project involves expanding a kitchen into a enclosed porch area. The porch is 2x8 joist (spanned 11') with 3/4" T&G strip (likely syp or fir). I need to raise the floor nearly 7" to match the height of the existing kitchen floor. 

I had initially thought to cut out the existing floor and add/sister new joist to increase height. It will be covered with tile so the deflection of the 2x8 is maxed out. 

Would installing sleepers directly over the existing floor be an option? It would be much easier, but I'm concerned the strip flooring is not as dimensionally stable as plywood/osb. My fear is if a board would buckle, it could compromise the sleeper assembly carrying the new 3/4" plywood, CBU, and tile. However, dimensional joist carrying traditional subfloors are not exactly dimensionally stable either. I've seen sleepers done over plywood before, but never strip. Is it plausible?Remodeling Contractor Scranton PA

Scranton PA Kitchen RemodelingI hear sleepers I think on the flat. You say you need 7". I cant see the whole situation but I assume you dont want to pull the existing joists because the walls are framed up on top of the perimeter.
Could you leave the joists in place, pull the T&G then add 2x10 in between? Dont forget you can notch the rim joist ends 1/4th.
Its a bigger job if you didnt plan on this but then your tile is safer moving forward.We do tapered sleepers on our older historic retrofits regularly. Joist over decking over joist. Shoot laser, mark lines, snap line or worse connect points, rip, repeat.

Heres a standard archi deg. Pretty straight forward.PhilI had originally planned to rip the subfloor, install new joist to meet elevation and put new plywood down. Sleepers was a secondary consideration. I know sleepers are common for leveling, but wasn't sure if there's a hidden risk (excluding deflection) of this method over plank. I would have no concerns with going over plywood with sleepers.Remodeling Contractor Scranton PA

I need to level floors in a ranch, built on a block foundation, piers every 8'. The girders holding the floor joists are sagging due to age (no rot). They are 3 2x8's laminated together. The house sags to the center about 3''. 

I was planning on cutting the gap in between piers from 8' to 4', cutting the crawlspace floor, pouring a 2x2x2 crete spread footing, and anchoring an adjustable support jack to slowly level and permanently fix the issue. 

This is the best way i can think to level the house without putting in new girders. Any advice is appreciated.

8' span for a tripple 2x8 is definitely exceeding the span for a 3-2x8.

You have the right remedy to fix this, but jacking up bowed triple girder that been this way God knows how long could cause some serious issues within the structure and is not as simple as you think. I'm certain any engineer will tell you that you have to replace the girder all together (I'm sure you will talk to Engineer before you do anything, right?), because there is a good chance you will be lifting the ends of that beam also. 
If that was my house or my job, I would change the girder without thinking twice about it.

Good luckI never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​I like that advice, I would be replacing everything with LVLs. Dimensional girders shrink a bit and dry out so there is a natural sag with time, because it is so dry it will split before it flexes back into shape.
I doubt the spread of original pier footings were adequate to begin with so I would rather build temp walls on both sides and replace everything.
Better than a forest of columns.I took a look at the crawl space again today, I forgot to mention i only have 2' of clearance so this work is not going to be pleasant. Regardless i am scraping the jack idea and going with replacement. Meeting with the engineer tomorrow so i will let you know what he says, but replacing the beam is definitely the right way to do it2 feet is practically sitting up room. Most of the stuff I deal with I might have a foot, 18 inches if I'm lucky.

From a practical standpoint, your plan is best bang for the buck.

Have to keep in mind you are not restoring the Mona Lisa, just sticking a Velvet Elvis back in the frame.You're gonna need some jacks and 4x fours just to get the floor straightened up before you replace the beam anyway.

Techno Metal Post - SJ Facebook Page
Techno Metal Post - SJ Web SiteI flipped a house a couple of years ago with almost your exact same scenario. House had sagged between each of the stanchion posts over time, then someone had made it worse at some point by jacking the house slightly and shimming the beam at each post. Just make the problem worse. 

Wasted about a week worth of crawling in and out of that muddy hole (there were also serious grading issues that we had to deal with) trying to jack it here and lower it there.... Ended up replacing it totally after realizing we were beating a dead horse:

Had a local steel supplier cut a full length steel I-beam. Had it diced into three pieces measured to terminate over a stanchion (so we could fit it down the hole into the crawl) . Got four or five guys down there with cheap ass Harbor Freight car jacks set on wood platforms for support, used vertical and horizontal 4x4 scraps to jack the house up section by section, knocked the old sistered beam out, and replaced with steel. Took one good long day. 

Had a guy go down the next day and attach all three sections together at the seams with 1/4" steel plates and through bolts. 

Saved more than 6k off what the foundation contractor wanted to do the work. 

Perfect? I dunno. It was our first time. And the floors were a hell of a lot better when we were done. 

Did break one large window and cracked some drywall above, but that seemed almost inevitable.

I was waiting on you to chime in... Your helical's will go below any soft surfaces that could move over time. Dan do you do under house helical's. There's a company around here that can use very short helical's and keep bolting on more while using a pneumatic or hydraulic tow behind compressor thing to twist them down some 15 to 45' deep.

Greensboro, NCI don't know of any brackets from Simpson that are useful for shear conditions also. Generally they are only for static gravity loads (which, being Earth-bound is a redundancy I know).

Ask your boss/mentor how he wants it done. I like to caulk them on the inside to the ceiling. 

Are you sure someone's plastic diaper, wrapped and taped on, isn't leaking around the edges, and that is why a fan is desired? 

If you want more advice a better description would be helpful. Like does this bathroom have a shower or tub? What is the attic insulation? Does the fan need to be vented outside?

Yes.Is it just a fan only? The fan housings themselves are generally not air tight at all. I will usually seal off any holes in the housing with foil tape. If you are running vent line into a cold attic is use insulated flex duct or insulate rigid duct properly. Topping the fan housing with an air tight insulated box is the best method though.That's what I ended up doing. My boss doesn't explain how to do anything.

I’m converting a basement into a finish in law quarters / apartment. 
- 9ft Ft ceilings (excavated). 
- Foundation is combination of old river stone repointed , block retailing, and new concrete blown in with pump (built like pool wall). 
- Floor has 4” gravel 6ml plastic (turned up side walls about 6” including the black plastic waffle in between wall and slab and 4” pad with wire. 
- French drain all around tied in to sump pump. 

Everything is clean and other the water table rising when we have continuous rains into the sump pump it’s bone dry. 

I haven’t finished any basements in a while but when I did I used to use 3.5” pink 
Sill plate gasket. Pt bottom plate and stick frame or metal stud up. Green (bathroom) drywall. 

Insulation: spray foam 1” I’m debating on spending the money (approx. $1500) to going all the way to floor. Keep in mind I have 9ft ceilings 4 of which are above frost line and 5ft below. Not sure if there will be any benefit or over kill / waste of money. The only advantage I see is it would prevent any moisture from getting through which would probably worth for long term. 

MY QUESTIONS: 

BEST FRAMING ALL METAL OR LIKE MENTIONED ABOVE. ?

BEST DRYWALL?

I would frame with wood. Careful with metal, you might get objections from homeowners.

Regular drywall is fine. The only time you need something different is if you have moisture or ventilation issues.

The only time you need foam insulation is if your walls are too thin to get the R value with fiberglass. But I don't know what R value is required in your area.I am the ho. I own the building.SLSTech said:

...So your planning on spraying over shotcrete with closed cell? That seems good to me, just keep the frame off of the spray foam an inch for an air space. Here in Ontario, our required R-value for basement walls is up to R-19, with closed cell being about an R-6 per inch, you would still be required to install R-14 batt's in the studs bays.Morning Wood said:

Interesting, it's not code here, you have the choice to use sill gasket or poly under a normal spf plate. But if I had the choice I'd be going with P.T bottom plate WITH sill gasket.Check the necessary thickness of cc foam to get a moisture barrier. I know it's 2" with xps foam so it's probably similar with cc foam. After you have that you can use any kind of drywall. Green board is pretty much bs from what I've read.

One extra step you can take, if you feel like it, is to run a strip of 1/2 ply on the bottom of the wall and then bring the drywall down to it with a little gap. The baseboard goes over the ply and the gap but it will prevent moisture from wicking if you ever do get a wet floor. If you're putting batt insulation in anywhere, don't bother doing this as it will wick anyway.Jaws;1780140 said:

Extruded polystyrene is a closed cell foam board. To my understanding, after 1" it's considered a class 1 vapour retarder. You shouldn't need a poly vapour barrier if your spraying, if you do use one your potentially trapping in moisture and creating a condensing plane.carp.addict said:

I would hit the walls with closed cell and run it up into rim joists. I'd also run it down and hit the slab. I did that in one of my basements that is just storage. Hit it with the fire retardant paint after. I think I did 3" though. Can't remember fully. Since you have exposed concrete above grade any moisture in the foundation can dry to the exterior exposed section. So you are good in that regard. I'd stud up your wall with either a PT or composite decking(with spf on top of it) bottom plate and Roxul batts in the wall. Regular drywall after the fact. 

In the future I'd sacrifice ceiling height for insulation under the slab. 4" minimum, but anything is better than nothing.Morning Wood said:

more proof of stupid people in real life:thumbup:I'm working on a 1930's bungalow in the Midwest. It has interior plaster and wood lath walls in good shape. The exterior is old bevel siding with tar paper behind it. In the areas where I tore out the plaster (mostly kitchen), the tar paper was in bad shape at the lower walls.

I'd like to try to insulate the walls if possible. I'd also like to avoid residing or tearing out all the plaster.

I've seen many old houses insulated by drilling small holes across the siding and blowing in. I assume this is my only option. It would make sense to open long channels at the top of interior walls and go in that way, in my situation.

Any opinions or experience, good or bad, using this method? Cellulose I assume?

NEC violation to do that.X2 on making sure you don't have moisture problems before going forward. Also, try air sealing before doing the insulation, particularly the attic.

I'm biased towards drilling from the inside, since you always compromise the building envelope drilling from the outside.

It's the opposite with older homes, they are much more breathable, I wouldn't worry about air laden moisture too much in this situation as long as the exterior is cladded properly with no liquid water infiltration.carp.addict said:

It's got claps right over studs. Not keeping water 100% out of that ever.

YouTubeBlown in insulation is really the only practical option if you want to be non invasive and keep the labour hours down. Keep in mind that there are different material choices for blown-in insulation. I would go with mineral wool, it's fire retardant, more sound absorbent and can get wet with out impeding it's performance where most insulation would absorb and sag leaving air pockets.with a foam injection system you can drill one 1/4 or 3/8 hole and fill a stud bay top to bottompappagor said:

If your going to do that though you better make sure you get all your wires run first, because if you have to change something your in for a fight.I've remodeled a lot of homes with blown in cellulose and I was always impressed how good the cellulose looked. Seldom signs of moisture and seldom any voids.

However the construction around here on 1930s and older homes had studs, 1xs, tar paper, then clapboards.

I should add that the ones with foam always appeared to have been done wrong. Big voids, shrunken foam chunks that let air all around, etc.

It's not worth doing it yourself or even sending your own guys up!You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.What is used for insulation right now?

Our house had rodent infestations for years to the point the poop was piled over 1/2" in places. I did all the removal and re-insulation myself. YUCK! I pulled about 20 dead bodies out. It was an insane amount of work. Included foaming the top plates to the drywall and filling in all electrical penetrations (Highly recommended). Then I had a friend feed the Home Depot machine and we blew in cellulose to an R60 depth. Overkill in Norcal, but the cost was not much more. The job left me bruised on my ribs, and hips. It was a serious yoga workout working in the low space with can lights everywhere, which I describe as trying to avoid laser detection on the way to stealing the crown jewels in a movie. My attic required electrical, structural, and all kinds of other jobs far beyond a normal insulation project. 

As suggested I would recommend letting the pros do it. They come in with a GIANT truck mounted vacuum if it is loose fill. Then they can use a very powerful blower far better than what Home Depot etc loan out for blowing the insulation in. 

Of course spray foam offers benefits, but some complain of allergies to the foam.

I'd go with an insulation sub, if possible.A customer has a 39-inch wide, 28" deep alcove in their kitchen. We're going to replace what's in there with deep cabinets below, and a TV and sound system, in the top part. The idea is to be able to watch TV in the (large) kitchen, and get a significant improvement in sound compared with the Bose radio sitting on one of the counters, without needing or wanting to have a system to blast during a party. The ceiling inside the alcove is 91" high - we can mount the TV high, but I don't think it belongs all the way at the top.

The alcove is next to the passage from the kitchen to the dining area, and everything needs to be flush-mounted or mountable in a shallow recess, out of the way of traffic but easy to access, all at chest level or higher. We can put some small directional speakers up high. There's no room to put a sub-woofer or other components elsewhere in the room. This is not my area of expertise at all. It feels to me that something like the home equivalent of a car sound system would work.

Budget - it's a very nice home, but the owners aren't interested in an audiophile system. The idea is to be able to listen to music and watch football games in the kitchen.

The new custom maple cabinetry in the alcove (above the deep pullouts below) will be designed around these choices. As the alcove is 28" deep, there's plenty of space to do whatever we need to mount hardware, run ventilation out to the top, whatever.

The speaker high up will increase the sound stage. If they ain't audiophiles this will actually sound good. Ideally you want them at ear level if you are being anal. Increasing the height of the speakers is a trick Bose use to make their speakers sound better to people who don't have a clue. It does work though.

I'll look at the Sonos soundbars. 

If I read the Sonos web site correctly, one also needs something called the Connect, to take audio from analog sources (CD, radio, other MP3 player) and play it through the Sonos soundbar.

Would there be any problem (not really an equipment, but more an audio question) with putting a Soundbar above the TV, 7' up on the wall? Is that going to sound odd (hey, why is the sound coming from way up there?) or is the sound so generally room-filling that it won't be an issue?

Given that there will be a 28-inch deep space behind the TV, does it makes sense to put a sub-woofer behind the TV, maybe with baffles or screens around the edges? The purpose would be to add something to the sound, not to rattle the house.

I appreciate the help, here. My goal is to present them with a design for the cabinetry that will work with a good system, based on sound (ha ha) principles. I'm not going to buy and resell the system to them, as I don't want to be responsible for resales taxes, warranty issues, etc.

It is what it is, if you have to mount it high mount it high, if there is a big space behind put the TV on a swing arm and hang the bad off of that with bracket extensions.The Following User Says Thank You to Inner10 For This Useful Post: Leo GBCConstruction said:



The speaker high up will increase the sound stage. If they ain't audiophiles this will actually sound good. Ideally you want them at ear level if you are being anal. Increasing the height of the speakers is a trick Bose use to make their speakers sound better to people who don't have a clue. It does work though. Again not ideal but they will be happy I'm sure

What's the cost on the Auto-Chlor?

Click to expand...

I don't have a number back on that specific one, but here's a similar unit with a list price. Under cabinet, to fit in the same space as a normal residential unit. I've never dealt with one of these before. Looks as if I need to account for adjacent space for detergent and rinse, depending on the unit get some rough plumbing done (most don't have drain pumps), maybe wire for 220, etc. Looks to me like the upfront cost is north of $3K, maybe 7 or 8.

It's for a professional chef. I'm not sure that even though she has years of experience in restaurant kitchens, she understands the tradeoffs - you have to preclean; you get the 90-second cycle only if you're running multiple loads, else there's some pre-heating time; you do one rack at a time, and need to store racks for glasses, dishes, etc., when they're not being used. We'll see.- BobI'm trying to get them to realize what they are trading off also.

I've installed 3 Bosch units in similar scenarios and they are working great.

The unit I mentioned above is 4 grand.

Normal plumbing and 208v.One thing to consider is water temps. Most residential waste systems can't take 180 degree water. The first unit you linked has an optional booster heater, but it looks like the second one is just standard. I don't know if they will work without it hooked up.My dad gave me concrete tools for my 18th birthday. 37 years later and I still haven't come up with a mean enough way to get him back.Be careful with Auto-Chlor. They require you to buy into a whole system, which includes their chemicals.

There are basically 2 types of commercial dish machines, hi-temp, and lo-temp, or chemical.

Hi-temp are just that. The wash cycle runs at 140 or so degrees, and the rinse/sanitize cycle runs at a minimum of 180 degrees for 15 seconds.

Lo-temp rely on a proprietary chemical for sanitization, and run no more that 120 degrees. They do a far inferior job of cleaning than hi-temp, and chemicals are expensive.

As far as plumbing and electrical go, a hi-temp machine has a booster heater for the rinse cycle. Most of the machines I've installed and worked on use a 60 or 80 amp breaker, but are quite larger than the one you showed. Smaller, under-counter models will require less.

Here, we use ABS pipe for everything, and there's never been a problem with the pipe in any the commercial establishments that I do service work for. As far as I know, and I'll prolly get flamed by a real plumber for this, but I believe that ABS is rated for 180 degrees. I know that CPVC is rated for 180, however.

Its going to be a mix.

We currently have Samsung. When we remodeled this house we moved into the basement first and put a kitchenette down there. Some of the appliances are staying down there. Only the fridge is coming up to the new kitchen on the main level.

Existing refrigerator is Samsung.

That's why I was asking what the rest were. We have all Bosch 800 series appliances and just got the matching microwave. Because, like you said, most are made in the same place.I do a fair number of bathroom renos, and I'm starting to run into an issue on my drains.

I was taught to put a bead of silicone between the tub and the drain flange, then screw the flange in tight. Used this method for years.

Well, I've had two drains fail to seal recently. One I think the silicone squeezed out when tightening. The other I'm not sure why it did it.

I reset both and they seemed fine after that, but I don't like having plumbing fail, and I don't like having to do things twice.

Is there a better way to set drains? Or did I just have bad luck twice in a row?Your Dreams won't work unless you do.​I still use putty. Im set in my waysWhenever possible I try and install the drain flange at least a couple hours ahead of when I will install the tub or shower.

The water can/will pass the gasket though the threads on the basket and nut. You need to stop the water at the basket flange to sink mating surface. If the surface(s) was perfectly flat it may not be and issue. I believe it is American Standard that supplies a white gasket for between the flange and sink on their lav drains.

True about the overflow, but that is passing water not standing water that has a head pressure.

the trip lever in a tub is way past the actual drain, head pressure would still be on both sides of tub.

One thing I do sometimes is smear a fine covering of teflon paste to the washer, no oil based dope...or double up or use a thicker washer the problem tubs.

You need to join squarely as possible not distorting the fittings. Watch out for cross threading by lubing lightly as well. Use the proper tub wrench.

Recently I had a building inspector tell me that you cannot use the flexible aluminum ducting for more than 3' for a bathroom exhaust fan and the rest has to be solid metal piping. I've never heard of this code in my 19 years of remodeling experience. I even asked the inspector to cite the code on this and she couldn't give it to me. I've been doing research on the specific code on the type of fan ducting to use to show my customer. Common sense would say that hard pipe would be the most ideal type material to use but nowhere can I find that flexible aluminum ducting is in fact a code violation. Anyone have a link or more info on this exact code the inspector speaks of. She even said you shouldn't use UL listed duct tape approved for use on bathroom fan ducting :blink:A.W. Davis Construction Co.
http://www.awdavisremodel.com/
Your friendly remodeling contractorNever have seen that in the RC.

Currently using flex metal transitioning to pvc, zipties won't hold, so using duct tape.

If it ain't in writing, it ain't real.M1507.2 Recirculation of air. Exhaust air from bathrooms and toilet rooms shall not be recirculated within a residence or to another dwelling unit and shall be exhausted directly to the outdoors.
M1507.2 Exhaust air from bathrooms and toilet rooms shall not discharge into an attic, crawl space or other areas inside the building.

Unlike the dryer vent, the section of the code for bathroom fans don't say much how can be used and how it should be run... its more likely being directed to manufacturer suggestions. The biggest concern is to make sure water vapor and any possible condensation issues are directed to the outside and don't flow back into the house.I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​It is in writing but I do not remember code number. It was shown to me by inspector, same with duct tape. Has to be mechanically fastened with screws or clamps, metal tape over, not duct tape. 

Was not a local thing because we don't have that here.Here we use flex but are required to go up a size.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.She is completely wrong. 100% wrong. It is fine to use!!!!!!!!!Can't help you. We've been using flexible duct that is insulated. The only thing ever checked is whether or not it vents to the exterior of the house. We usually go into the soffit with a vent in the soffit. Not just dumping into vented soffit. Anytime I can avoid a penetration in the roof, I'll take it.builditguy said:

Click to expand...

If I have my druthers, I go out through a gable wall as first choice. That warm air going out through a soffit vent wants to rise, and a certain percentage of it will wind up back in the attic space if there's vented soffit.

I do agree that's usually better than a roof penetration, though.R303 Ventilation air from the space shall be exhausted directly to the outside.
R303.4.2 Exhaust openings. Exhaust air shall not be directed onto walkways.

M1501.1 Outdoor discharge. The air removed by every mechanical exhaust system shall be discharged to the outdoors.
M1501.1 Air shall not be exhausted into an attic, soffit, ridge vent or crawl space.

M1507.1 General. Where toilet rooms and bathrooms are mechanically ventilated, the ventilation equipment shall be installed in accordance with this section.
M1507.2 Recirculation of air. Exhaust air from bathrooms and toilet rooms shall not be recirculated within a residence or to another dwelling unit and shall be exhausted directly to the outdoors.
M1507.2 Exhaust air from bathrooms and toilet rooms shall not discharge into an attic, crawl space or other areas inside the building.The only other things that come to mind is:

- piping & ducting supported every 4 ft
- somewhere (under general?) it says in effect: "Something not covered by this code - follow manufacturers recommendations"

Might behoove OP to inquire of the BI if perhaps they inadvertently applied the codes that dryer & range ducts fall under(heat sources) to the fan installation.Thanks guys, so it seems the flexible aluminum ducting is code compliant just as I have suspected. We've always followed the code on bends in the ducting with no more than 360 degrees of turns, and always terminate the exhaust outside. I've never had an inspector have an issue with this type ducting....I hope they aren't failing everyone on this. One of our customers is expecting me to cite the code the inspector failed us on and for the life of me I cannot find anything anywhere on it. She believes that I should've known this was a current code. I cant honor a made up code some inspector made up because they were having a bad day. 

Now if we were remodeling a kitchen it would be a no brainer to use hard pipe with smooth seams on a hood.A.W. Davis Construction Co.
http://www.awdavisremodel.com/
Your friendly remodeling contractorYea, there's no code violation, but I would urge you to use hard pipe over flex anyway as you get less drag and friction which maximizes fan efficiency."Under promise, over deliver and all that!" JBM
supersealconstruction.com

https://www.facebook.com/Superseal-Construction-162699413750013/The back pressure from the fan exhaust pipe loads down the fan. 
The fan curve for a particular fan may show a recommended operating region for low noise and long fan life.

Even if the fan maker would give you this info, the back pressure is not easily measured by non-HVAC people.

I will say that for bathrooms, >8 air changes per hour is recommended and 15 is probably overkill. And you need a good gap at the bottom of the door.

The DIY method would be to put something stinky in a bathroom at time =0, then remove the stink generator, then have a different woman open the door every few minutes. 
Generating the stink is easy; getting all the women might prove difficult. []You will have very very little skin friction with rigid aluminum pipe. How long is the run?

The key question.....how long is the duct?????Ahhhh this topic. There have been threads about this, some came up with the flex actually helping the vortex of the exhaust if I remember.I'm a rebel, I went with 4" insulated flex duct for the vent fan in our master bath. Not to worried about duct resistance with 8 inches of run.

TomAsk her to cite the code section...........Under IRC / IECC - nothing as many have stated
Is there something in Title 24? 

As for best pipe - personally I prefer PVCSLS Construction & Building Solutions LLC Our Blog - The HTRCAnd.....PVC which I have used ....Was told is specifically not allowed. I think I read where the code focuses on heat producing equipment and then states something about all other ducts.....which sends you to duct construction. So I think inspectors repeat what they see in areas of the book and don't speak about what's not in the code.Yeah & correct me if I am wrong, but doesn't NJ also require the pipe to slope back to the fan, not outside if venting through the gable?SLS Construction & Building Solutions LLC Our Blog - The HTRCThis summer we remodeled a kitchen and added a range hood/vent to the exterior wall. This house was built in 1923, with double thick brick exterior walls. The wall is on the north side of the house. with recent high winds and cold temps, the homeowner is upset with the amount of cold air coming in through the hood. The wall vent we used has the flap on it, and there is a damper integrated into the hood as well. Was there anything else we could have done to mitigate the cold air?

My experience says that if you put some "rise" on the piping, it will reduce the amount of cold air coming back to the interior.MarkJames said:

That's what I need. Our vent clinks and clacks in the wind. No noticeable cold air, but the sound drives me nuts.- BobThere is no rise from damper on range hood. The 90 deg elbow sits right on top of the damper for the range hood. (I did verify the damper would open without hitting elbow) 

My original plan was to vent through the roof, but framing member made that impossible. Double 2x dead center of hole location

Only option was to go through wall, and only option was to keep it as low as possible on outside. Spray foam the void between the two layers of brick, and grouted from both sides for the penetration. Wind isn't getting through the penetration. 

You'd think the passive house crowd would have a solution to this.

A good question for a local repair outfit if you have any relationship. 

Side note on LG...generally I find their stuff has a short life but don't know about the ovens.Real chefs like convection ovens, so electric is considered superior. Although probably more expensive to run. 

I have a Kitchenaid II at home that is a dual fuel and it works great for what cooking we do. The $2500 list price was too much, but the $1000 I paid for it, having never been used, made it a good deal. The quality seems alright, but it is not even in the same league as a Wolf or Viking. 

Last year, from a higher end home remodel, I brought home some cabinets, that I gave away, and sold the appliances. Except I kept the microwave and still use it. The oven and stove were both Kitchenaid and they had held up well, mostly due to diligent cleaning.Californiadecks said:

The dual ovens don't have a storage drawer, so there is plenty of space. The annoying part is the convection fan takes up room at the back so your favorite casserole dish may not fit when rotated lengthwise.

Yes, but a true double oven will be separate of the stove anyhow. Unless you are talking a half oven not a full size oven. 

I really do like the dual fuel we got which I realized is a Kitchenaid Architect II series. It has a warming drawer which I have used a couple of times. 

Don't forget to put a pot filler in! :thumbsup:

Here are some dual fuels from lowes.

BTW If you have a chase card you can buy Lowes (Maybe HD?) gift cards for 10% off through chases website. FREE money plus points!

Edit: If you were thinking of a stove/oven combo, another thought might just be to get an awesome toaster oven, and get a single oven on the stove. When baking pies, etc. the Breville is what we use. Living with a French woman it is used twice daily for bread too. The Breville is why our main oven is very rarely used. it works that well.

Also, some of the dual fuels are very underpowered. I have 60 amps 220 going to our double electric ovens. Just because you can buy an oven that draws 20, doesn't mean you want to.- BobI have installed 2 of those double oven ranges, after a few months both customers hated them because the bottom oven is way too low. The handle is close to the floor. If they only switched the smaller one to the bottom it may have been better.

The ranges with the warming drawer below are now popular, drawer get to 200 deg I think.

Just make sure to flush the lines into another pot every time you use it.

We never flush the lines (Other than upon first install). Then again our water quality is probably better than yours (Small vs big city), the lines are all copper, and it gets used almost every other day at least. Of course I won't drink the tap water until it has been run through an RO system. :whistling

I managed to steal a Hansgrohe pot filler off of Ebay that matches the kitchen faucet. Already had to cut the wall open to add a 220v circuit. Plus the kitchen was gutted, so it was a nice addition without too much trouble. All the ladies seem to want one...right up until they hear the installed price :laughing:

_______________I get calls quite often from people wanting to add a bedroom and a bathroom in their basement. Problem is they are often the standard ranch homes from the 50s or earlier with ceiling heights of about 6' 10" with beams and ducts and pipes running everywhere.

Code book says habitable areas need a minimum ceiling height of 7'. If we go by the book, permit & inspections, etc. then it would seem we are done before we even started.

What do you tell the homeowners? Sorry?Under 7' is a no go for us. Now the 84 1/2" ceilings have been huge money makets for us.Superior Remodeling Solutions
SRS Facebook Page
Techno Metal Post - SJ Facebook Page
Techno Metal Post - SJ Web SiteI've seen finished basements under 7', but I've never been asked to do one.Here we also have the 84" standard for code. That being said, one of three things happen. There are no permits, the inspectors understand and don't give you a hard time about it knowing that there is nothing you can reasonably do for a reasonable cost, or you apply for variance. With any of the three options, regardless of egress, it won't be counted as living square footage and/or a legal bedroom. The only area we have ever had issue with is maintaining as much head room clearance for stair codes.Or option 4
The inspector gives the homeowner a fine and tells them to rip the non permitted, non code compliant work out. 

Except for laundry, hallways and storage, ceiling height is 90" here.


Can you make money on this work? Yep, but it has the risks associated with any non permitted work.Here it's 80".

You can always dig the basement out or raise the house. In some places a $120,000 basement reno is worth it to add 1000 square feet of good space.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.If the homeowner has sufficient resources, a dig out of the basemsnt is something to be considered.

But it's not for the legit guy.:no::no:Do i need a vaour barrier in a pool house and bar that is in canada and is exposed to the harsh climate ,it will have some heaters for chilly nights but only really used in the summer.my client wants to drywall the inside and tape it,i personally think wood panelling and no vp would be the way to to go.its has potlight which also will generate some heat and a big rolling bar hatch.

Plus its getting insulated with R 20 roxal its a a big pool house with 2x6 framing and a large covered open roof which we are currently adding cedar t and g to.

Any advise would be appreciatedPersonally I think I would just paint the interior walls with at least two coats of a quality vinyl paint and let that act as the vapor (Vapour for you Canuks) barrier.


Andy.https://andytardif.wixsite.com/websiteIf it's going to be heated then that warm air is going to want to get out and if it's not controlled the water in the warm air will condense when it cools down to the dewpoint, right? Therefore it would seem that some sort of vapor barrier would be a good idea, maybe just the paint like SA suggests or maybe something more elaborate, 

I'm in a warm area but really want to understand and have a solid handle on this issue as it can cause a lot of problems from reading horror stories about warm interior air meeting cold airIf there is any chance of the interior getting any heat, the vapour (vapor for the Yanks) barrier should be used on the warm side.
Optionally, a closed cell spray foam. But that can get expensive.I don't see any reason not to. Personally I'm not a fan of poly, but some of the of the AHJ's just want to see it. I'm more inclined to use paint with a good air barrier. Might as well detail it just like a house in case the owner wants to use it as a guest house down the road (if it's as big as you're saying). 

I guess the question is why wouldn't you put a vapour barrier if you're going to insulate it? Just to save a couple bucks?Not sure what you mean by open roof but the first rule is figure out how you are going to handle all that moisture or you are going to have issues. Is the pool drained for the winters or heated to prevent freezing?

As for handling moisture, it can include some items as simply using a pool cover tied into much more complex items like keeping the interior temps above the dew point level while utilizing an ERV to help exhaust moisture.

As for wood panels versus drywall - drywall like densarmour is the most forgiving for this type of application. As for the "potlight" those are just asking for issues as they allow warm moist air directly into whichever assembly you haveSLS Construction & Building Solutions LLC Our Blog - The HTRCThanks everyone for taking the time to replyIf you are building a wood structure that is to be conditioned space, you need to be certain that your client has a contract with a design firm, and that you follow the design to a t. Cold climates with a wood structure surrounding a pool have a lot of opportunity for failure. Cover your bases and be certain that you aren't the one deciding what the best method is for designing a building that is to be built from wood and maintain 99% humidity year round regardless of the outside tempsIf you are treating the room as a conditioned space build the whole structure with that in mind. If they are just using heat in the fall for a few chilly nights and then it won't get used again till spring, then you probably won't have an issue at all. But you could use a smart vapor retarder and cover all your bases. When people say they won't use it that much, they usually use it alot.

This is the way to learn----your local tile store should have the names of contractors for you---

When I started building shower pans, I hired a pro to teach me---

Doing a shower wrong could bankrupt you---if you are just starting out.
Better to hire the pro and add a small mark up--or simple watch and learn and chalk up the cost as a learning expense.

Look at the tile projects here----you will learn a lot from those---Your proposed ideas are completely wrong... Listen to what these guys are saying... Hire it out.- Alex :thumbsup:

Facebook PageIt's not that hard to drypack a shower pan and slope it correctly. I learned by hiring a great tile setter that was willing to teach me, after helping him with the first two I paid him to watch me do the third and I have done many since then on my own. It is critical that it's done right, and can pass a flood test. I would call around to local tile guys and find somebody willing to teach you.My first shower was my own years ago...since then I have learned a ton by reading here, product manuals, TCNA guidelines, etc. I don't hesitate to sell and self install a full tile shower now but for a few years I was only comfortable doing a fiberglass base and then tile walls. We have a sub who is also cool with me shadowing him or doing the complete install.

Yes, that slope idea is horribly wrong, and it alone seems like an indication that he should at least get some help with the project.

One way to look at it is by considering price. New guys often get burnt by underestimating the scope, and discovering the true extent of the work and the cost to complete it, as the project continues.

Along that line: Is is plausible to you that your price for this shower could be $20,000? I'm making a lot of assumptions, and I don't know your location, and I'm not saying that should be your price, but if that price isn't plausible to you, then you are missing some important points, and you should get some help figuring out the work.

Then he wasn't very "open to any ideas or CRITICISM".

He also said that he is new to this. Whether that is self employment or shower building or both, we don't know and can only assume that since he put that statement after the questions concerning the shower, it is that in which he was referring.

Either way, and regardless of what you may have done in a similar situation, it is still sound advice, and not likely to run someone off, to get someone who has experience with this type of project, to either complete the project or assist in order to ensure the project is completed to industry standards.Tried & True on Facebook

The answer is its up to the local municipality they are the Authority Having Juridiction (AHJ) .
Across the sunshine bridge from me is Pinelles county they have i think 12 or ? more citys, Whats good for one may not be good for all

Not in a residential application over an electric rangeI've never done one without it, even if its an empty metal hood. Never checked the code on it either, but have ALWAYS put one. Its really not safe to have cooking heat go straight up- if something catches on fire...

Though you say there are no cabinets above, I'd still recommend getting a 40 dollar jammie.Are you guys installing towel bars and robe hooks in your new bathrooms or do you leave them for the homeowner?

I hate these stupid I things. It's always cheap junk with tiny wrenches you can't hold. Homeowner wants it here. No, there. No, 2 inches up. No, just 1 inch. Nah, maybe 2 inches. What about over here? 

I'm going home, call me when you decide!

I usually decline the honor but I let myself get talked into it this time. Never again.A couple suggestions.

Line item the install of that stuff (eg. $400-500), and let them know it's optional and ok if they do it themselves....but tell them to be careful they don't screw up!

Use your blue tape to mark the placement while they are there. I always mark the top of the thing, or top/left corner.

Don't use the garbage wall fasteners that come with the things.

Edit: take that figure with a grain of salt, but I'm not off by much. those things can drive me nuts, too.It's a PITA but part of doing a bathroom project. 

Just figure accordingly on the next one and you will have no problem smiling and saying yes maam. ok maam. Not a problem maam. I will sit here all day maam...

FYI I blue tape the areas out ahead of their involvement for the different items so at least they have a target to focus on instead of them looking at a complete blank slate and almost hear their inner voice trying to talk them through what they saw on HGTV.

Have the items unboxed and I Vanna White em for the homeowner. Once they say there, I mark it with a pencil and move onto the next item.

I do refuse to install robe hooks into the back of hollow core doors though.I always install those on y bath wrap ups. I put it in the contract that I will install it if they buy it.I think my biggest complaint is the included Allen wrench that is so small you can hardly tell whether or not it's even in your hand. And the set screw is 3/32 from the wall. 

Then, when I finally bottom out the set screw the hook still rattles on its mount.

I prefer a decorative fastener to the hidden set screw system.Tom M said:

I'd like to do the opposite. I'll install them if you pick from this list of contractor approved hooks and bars that can be installed without inducing an aneurism.

I did one bathroom that got locally hand-forged bars and hooks. Exposed decorative flat-head screws right into the framing. What a dream.We always install them, some brands are easier than others. The Kohler stuff is pretty nice to install, the set screw is an inch or so from the wall so the key is able to do complete rotations. For robe hooks in hollow core doors I use 1/8" toggle bolts and they seem to hold up to basic robe and towel use.

I usually let the customer know the night before I'll be installing them, give them a general idea where I think they should go, and leave them with a roll of blue tape to mark the locations. It gives them a chance to discuss with the hubby/wifey and mull it over for a bit without wasting any of my time.

I'll take installing basic accessories in drywall over installing grab bars in tile showers any day of the week. Some of the new tiles can take 10-15 minutes per hole even with the nice diamond core bits. Just did a walk in shower for an older couple who wanted 4 grab bars. Of course this was decided after it was all done, so no blocking.  The tile was made of undrillabletanium.......I didn't think I was ever gonna finish!tipitop;2919985 said:

My thoughts exactly...or even worse...they blow out some drywall or plaster and you gotta go back and patch and paint. 

My work is my advertising......wouldn't want to put a picture of some other guys ass on my billboard.

I always have extra hrs. in my punchlist item to account for this work.

I've also told clients to go back and try again....."you don't want this junk in your nice bathroom" :no::no:

I didn't even know about those ball-end allen wrenches until I picked up a set for a buck at a yard sale. :thumbsup:I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas. I have always understood that basement walls can be put in if the ceiling height is less than 7' if the ceiling is not drywalled. My ceilings in the basement are 7' 7 3/4". I put the walls up around the laundry area and around an addition on the back, up against the basement walls (to code). I never tried to hide what I was doing, because I had it drawn on my blue-print I submitted to the city. When I got my rough-in inspection done, I was informed that all the walls would have to be torn out. 

Just some thoughts, and ways I could avoid tearing everything out. What if I wanted (and I do) insulate the exterior walls from heat loss? Also, what about wall built under structural beams? This is helping give the house more stability, and I took the fireplace out, which was supporting an outside wall that is now an inside wall due to an addition put on in 1928 (my house was built in 1915)

Also, a closet, hallway, and laundry room are not considered habitable space, even if the walls and ceiling are finished, so what is the problem? There is no habited space there no matter what the walls look like. I was planning on using the one room for the dogs, there is no closet in it.

The building inspector won't allow walls because "some future person might see that and think they can make a bedroom out of it." Someone will use the basement for a bedroom even if their are no walls (I see it all the time, and no window), I don't have any control over what some future person might do with the space. I also prefer the walls over the ugly foundation, which is stepped in places.

Thanks in advance for your input.Residential builder/remodelerRooms with doors make habitable spaces.

Not walls.

Not ceilings.

Not 7', x" heights.

Habitable rooms are living, sleeping, eating and cooking rooms. Common terms for these rooms include living rooms, family rooms, dens, bedrooms, breakfast rooms, dining rooms and kitchens. These rooms can occur anywhere in the home including basements and attics. Bathrooms, laundry rooms, closets, storage rooms, equipment rooms and hallways are not habitable rooms.

https://www.facebook.com/Superseal-Construction-162699413750013/I was once told that for a room to be classified as habitable it had to have a window above a certain size. I was also told this same thing by a realtor who come to value my house as he said none of the rooms in my basement can be advertised as bedrooms, living rooms etc etc because the windows were too small. He also said that the bedrooms had to have a min size closet too for them to be classed as a bedroom.www.thecoastalcraftsman.comI finished our basement with similar height ceilings and got a lot of resistance for a bedroom we intended to put down there. This was adjacent to the boiler, water heater, etc. They kept telling me don't do it, and I kept asking but how CAN I do it? Answer: egress window + firewall + sufficient combustion air obtained from hallway (and not directly from the bedroom). So I now have a corridor behind the bedroom for the utilities.Every bit of what makes a space habitable vs occupied, including min sq footage, egress, etc is spelled out in the rules adopted by the municipality.

Something like 90% now use one of the IRC revisions, the rest IBC.

Either way, they are described in plain language, and every licensed contractor should already know how to find and interpret these codes. Being at the mercy of some shirt saying "because I said so", is crazy.

And yes, the OP needs to appeal this one.Be calm and professional for the inspector. Let him understand that you are going to ask the Building Official or at least someone who has greater authority.

You said you submitted prints to the city, I assume then that those were approved.
This should trump any **** the inspector says.

Andy.https://andytardif.wixsite.com/websiteUsually a situation with an inspector is not an issue like this where there are such different interpretations of the applicable code.

Interesting to see how this plays out....

Why does Contractor think he is right?

Why does inspector think he is right?

Good luck...:thumbsup:I don't necessarily think I'm right, other than I'm not making this into inhabited space, and my primary defence is based on what other people have told me in the past. I'm just looking for something on the books that would support my case.

The old inspector let me get away with 6' 8", but that was for a drywall ceiling and "inhabited" space. By the reason of the first poster, i could remove all doors, and widen the door opening to the a-joining walls.

We frequently puts rooms in basements without a large window, and we don't put a closet in them so it isn't considered a bedroom. I always thought the loophole for low ceilings was not drywalling the ceiling. I should legally have the right to insulate my exterior walls, and have my hot water heater and furnace in a closet.

He also didn't like my stairs. There used to be no headroom, you had to duck to get downstairs. I opened up as far as I could so that an average size human can walk down them and not bump their head.

I understand the need for codes for new buildings, just think that there should be an exception for pre-existing conditions.Residential builder/remodelerabacab said:

Yup, that is the gist of it.

Remember the old saw "if it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, etc"

The moment you create a room using a door, and it is NOT a furnace, equipment room, etc, it's now a HABITABLE space.

And the moment it becomes HABITABLE, all other current code will be brought to bear.

That's called change of use.

You by rights should be able to stud out perimeter walls and insulate.

You cannot "grandfather in" new work over existing.:no::no:

Stairs are fine as were, until a change of use - as when OCCUPIED becomes HABITABLE.

If your entire scope of work is only studding perimeter walls and insulating, and even if you wall off and put a door on the furnace/water heater area, you have not created new, non-conforming HABITABLE space.

The BI would still have every right to demand DW on furnace room and provide make-up air.

- stairs could stay the same, no change of use.
- ceiling could remain the same, no change of use.

Like in the 2nd part of what I quoted (right from IRC 2009), the minute you create a space with a door that does not fall under the description of utilitarian functions listed, you now have a HABITABLE space.

Suddenly, ALL of it matters:
- stair treads and headroom
- ceiling height
- sq footage of room
- closet
- ceiling height
- window(s) and egress requirements
- smoke detectors
- make-up air

- etc - probably some I missed.

Me, even if I had on review "inadvertently" crossed the line, I'd rip out the offending bits, and keep the insulated walls.

And file an appeal.

And then I'd confirm which code book the community is using NOW, bone up on them and submit a highlighted copy of the relevant parts with my appeal.

And no, this is not speculation on my part: In the mid/late-2000s, we were offering insulated basement walls on our completed new builds. Stud walls, R17, 1/2" board, cut batts to bonds above the DW.

BI initially claimed we were created a new HABITABLE space, which required separate permitting/review, AND DW on ceiling AND egress.

He claimed exactly the same as you: those new DW walls "might" be used for living space some day. Well, yes they "might", but then there would be doors, egress, ceiling DW, etc. But not our problem TODAY now, is it?

The errors of his ways pointed out, we proceeded as planned.

I would wish you good luck, but you don't need it. Just be clear on what you are doing, and it'll fly.:thumbsup:


Oh, and I realize nothing I've said matters a Tinker's D*mn in California, but neither of us plan on visiting that foreign land - do we?Here in Denver I can appeal the inspectors decision to the building department board of code appeals. I had to write out a explanation of the situation and also cite any and all codes that applied to my situation.He has to give you a reason why he wants the walls down. 

There is a portion of the code that deals with modifications done to existing structures which is less strict.

If you read the code:

404.3 Minimum ceiling heights. Habitable spaces, hallways, corridors, laundry areas, bathrooms, toilet rooms and habitable basement areas shall have a clear ceiling height of not less than 7 feet (2134 mm). 

Exceptions: 

1. In one- and two-family dwellings, beams or girders spaced not less than 4 feet (1219 mm) on center and projecting not more than 6 inches (152 mm) below the required ceiling height.
2. Basement rooms in one- and two-family dwellings occupied exclusively for laundry, study or recreation purposes, having a ceiling height of not less than 6 feet 8 inches (2033 mm) with not less than 6 feet 4 inches (1932 mm) of clear height under beams, girders, ducts and similar obstructions.
3. Rooms occupied exclusively for sleeping, study or similar purposes and having a sloped ceiling over all or part of the room, with a clear ceiling height of at least 7 feet (2134 mm) over not less than one-third of the required minimum floor area. In calculating the floor area of such rooms, only those portions of the floor area with a clear ceiling height of 5 feet (1524 mm) or more shall be included.
4. Manufactured housing regulated in the Residential Code of New York State shall be permitted to retain ceiling heights provided at time of manufacture.
5. Spaces legally in existence before January 1, 2003, and spaces for which a variance has been legally granted shall be allowed to be occupied.
6. Ceiling heights reduced by necessary repairs shall be no lower than 6 feet 8 inches. 

You should be OK per what you have and as the code goes, unless there is something more to it.I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​The Building Inspector is right.


2009 IRC: 

R310.1 Emergency escape and rescue required. Basements, habitable attics and every sleeping room shall have at least one operable emergency escape and rescue opening. Where basements contain one or more sleeping rooms, emergency egress and rescue openings shall be required in each sleeping room. <snip>  Emergency escape and rescue openings shall open directly into a public way, or to a yard or court that opens to a public way. 
Exception: Basements used only to house mechanical equipment and not exceeding total floor area of 200 square feet (18.58 m2).

R305.1 Minimum height. Habitable space, hallways, bathrooms, toilet rooms, laundry rooms and portions of basements containing these spaces shall have a ceiling height of not less than 7 feet (2134 mm). 

R305.1.1 Basements. Portions of basements that do not contain habitable space, hallways, bathrooms, toilet rooms and laundry rooms shall have a ceiling height of not less than 6 feet 8 inches (2032 mm). 


If your basement is bigger than 200sf, it's habitable space. It doesn't matter if you call it that or not - it's a room someone could and would be likely to lay down in and go to sleep. Once you pulled the permit to build the walls, you subjected that portion of the structure to the same requirements as a new one. You either put in an egress window and have 7' ceilings, or you tear the walls out.

I think these BS definitions of "bedroom" come from RE agents, and what has to constitute a bedroom for them to list it as one. The IRC doesn't even define a "bedroom", and it makes no difference to the code whether a room has a closet or not. If it's not a bath, closet, or hallway, it's habitable space. And habitable spaces require a means of egress and a 7' ceiling.

You do have a right to appeal, but I wouldn't hold my breath for a happy ending on that... I'd probably raise holy **** with whoever reviewed your plans and issued your permit though, because this should've been caught before the permit went out.XJCraver said:

What about that big red stamp that says they are not responsible for errors and/or omissions...or the op could have omitted something in the plans that is not seen by the codes official...regardless pissing on the inspector or the reviewer will not get you anywhere. 

State your case, ask what adjustments would need to be made so that you can leave the basement be as is.Thanks everyone. I will try to get it approved with exterior walls insulated, and walls under beamed areas such as where I took the fireplace out which used to hold up the center of the 10x10 bottom plate before the 1928 addition was put in. I currently have a door and locks on the room that has the electrical panel because someone already swiped my copper wire once. It's a catch 22 on the project, I can't move in because of codes, and I can't get insurance or a loan because it's not inhabited. I've done everything out of pocket, hoping it doesn't get vandalized before I can get a legal temporary occupancy permit.Residential builder/remodelergriz said:

We don't stamp that nonsense here on Residential plans. It either gets an ''Approved'' stamp, or I hand it back to you and tell you what needs fixed. 

Regardless, I still believe the OP should explain the situation to the Building Official (but maybe not raise h***). If the permit office is turning permits out on bad plans, that's bad for everyone.abacab said:

Can you post a floor plan?XJCraver:

I read the code differently, and my experience is different. 

There's nothing in that part of the building code that says that a separate room in a basement is a sleeping room, nor does the code say that a basement larger than 200 square feet is habitable. 

My experience is that you can put separate rooms in a basement, and as long as there is no evidence that the rooms are being used as bedrooms (no adjoining kitchen and bath, no bedroom furniture, etc.), building and housing departments have no problem with it.

I would appeal the decision.- BobVery often, a code official is smarter than the person trying to sneak something by is the cheating scheme. 

When you see a basement with walls, openings that is trying to get permitted, it cries out to tell many people it is just to sneak by with a minimal job and get an inspection for some sort of approval. - After that, it is a complete finishing job on the sly later to avoid a real inspection (and taxes) for a habitable/living space. Then, it could slip by later unless the inspection for a future buyer caught the sham scheme and then the sale could fall through.

It is always tempting to get a quick minimal improvement permit to avoid the problems that come later if the final finishing created a legally unusable space. - Not too much different than the foundation contractor that carries some short lengths of rebar to stick into the concrete being poured IF the inspector shows you. Unfortunately, inspectors can be wise, especially if the contractor does have enough steel on site to finish the rest of the strip footings for the foundation.

There seems to be no end to the schemes that some people go to in order to "play" with the inspectors at the expense of future owners.Dick

Engineer, designer and consultant recently active domestically and internationally on construction and design in about 40 countries.I have a customer wants a new bathroom in her basement. She is anticipating her 94 year old mother being wheelchair bound and is turning their finished basement into an in law. (all that has to be added is the bathroom.)

Notes:
The unfinished area of the basement is huge both in area and height. Where she wants it is right by the septic line so digging for the pit and pump is easy and I can almost configure the bathroom anyway i like.

My 3 biggest concerns
1. drainage for the shower with the roll in unit as it transitions from the tile. She is looking at a fiberglass unit (Freedom Shower) if I raise the floor to accommodate there has to be a ramp somewhere.

2. Drainage outside of the shower, I assume these do not contain 100% of the water.

3. She wants radiant floor heat due to the fact they hate cold floors.

Does any of you stout fellows have a system you have used to put a roll in shower on a basement slab with radiant floor heat?Why not do something like this?Tried & True on Facebook

www.danielsremodeling.buildi would like to see it Evan...thank uI just added the joist app. I've done some samples on it, but haven't done any for a customer. 

Couple of things I don't like. I enter the customer's name and address. Also the type of work being done. Where does this information go? It's not like I'm putting in SS# but I still wonder what will happen with that information.

It's on my phone and my tablet. These are not handy for typing. I have a keyboard for my tablet, but the whole thing is not convenient. 

I'm giving it a try. The world is always changing. I can keep using a pencil and legal pad, but what if I find out this is alot quicker and easier. It could happen. Just because I've always used pen and paper doesn't mean there is a better way.Nice find! Exactly what I am looking for. One main concern about this app is its security issue. The data is hosted in the cloud... you know apple got hacked last year...I use it and like it alot. The company seems to be quick to answer during the day if I need help figuring out something with their program. They also seem to like suggestions for improvements. Still not sure why it's free........but I'll take it.Update:
I've been using it since my last post. I've spent some time customizing it. Took a little bit to figure out. 

I was concerned about security and what happens to the information I put in. I did several test ones, to myself. So far, no phone calls or junk email. For customer's phone I don't put in the area code. It works for me and if they ever sell off the customer's information, it will be hard to call someone without the area code.

I really only use it for smaller jobs. I like being able to email it. I always sign it on the screen. I really like getting notified when the customer opens the email. That way I know they've seen it. 

I figure my job with paper and pencil. Type it out on my tablet. I also print a copy and put my figures and the estimate in a folder. I keep a separate folder for each customer.

I've been thinking about getting a larger chromebook or something like that. Something that is easier to type on.

One drawback. You have to have internet service to type anything in. I can't really take my tablet that many places to work on estimates. I don't usually do that anyway, but it might be nice to type in my information and then email it when I get somewhere with service. 

I have it on my phone also. I never use it. Typing on a phone is not for me anyway. I hate text messages, why would I want to do an estimate on my phone? 
I do like being able to pull up an estimate and look at it, if I need to. Haven't yet, but it seems handy for that.

As for my list of items, right now I type in a new item and price every time. I can see myself being able to pull items up from previous jobs and adding them to new jobs. It looks like it will be a time saver, once I get more stuff on there.I do, love itWould like some info on backsplash sizing. I am selling cabinets to a customer that wants 42" cabinets and 3" crown. She has an 8' ceiling. When I called the girl that does the drawings for the dealer I buy from, she proceeded to tell me you can't use 42" cabinets with 3" crown when you have an 8' ceiling. I've been doing this for a pretty long time and I have never heard than one before.

I asked her why and was this a code issue that I don't know about. She said that you wouldn't have 18" for a backplash. I have tiled countless backsplashes and the majority of them are 16", which is what you would have if you used 42,s and 3" crown. Then she proceeded to tell me that with only 16" you wouldn't be able to fit a coffee pot, or a blender under the cabinets, which is nonsense. She needs to have a better answer than that. Then she told me that it's just not the way you do it. 

From my experience, the size of the backsplash is a visual thing. You don't want to have it look like it is pinched down too much. As I said I have tiled countless 15-16" backsplashes and the customers have appliances, since I always tell them to remove them before we start tiling. Has anyone of you had any issues with backsplash size? Any info would appreciated. Is there something I'm missing hereI have read that 18" is code in IL but do not remember where.I had a custom cabinet shop years and have also installed many 16" backsplashes although I always tried to get 18 if I could.
If you have custom cabinets made using a wider top rail you can get 18" with 3" crown on a 42" cabinet .Or close to it after leveling.18" is standard but not code. 
I aim for 18" so if someone wanted 3" crown I'd go with 39" uppers especially if they are full overlay doors. I will fudge that 18" some if it's less than 3" crown/partial overlay doors where I can overlap the crown onto the face some.
Coffee makers will fit either way but some of the other appliances (blenders) may not.Don Sheppard Construction

Click to expand...16 is something that will the customer will regret later..... 
Don't tell us she wants a light baffle too.Bottom of cabinets are normally around 54 aff, which is 18" above a 36" counter.

I've seen lots closer to 16", but never anything that wasn't over 40 years old.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.I can only speak for here in NJ, there is no code requirement for backsplash height except in reference to the stove/range. Then it must be to the appliance manufacturers specs, which vary widely from model to model, almost all say 18" above counter. 

The distance it has to stay at 18 or higher away from the range varies. Many are 6" to right and left of range must be 18 or higher and no more than 13" deep cabinets on either side.

I spoke ti insurance claims adjuster last year, he said now if a kitchen fire is claimed they will measure cabinets if they are intact. I guess they will do anything to deny a claim.What does the BI say? That's the final word, no matter what designer chick says. 

4-5 years ago, I was doing a kitchen and the HO wanted her stovetop under a window. I wasn't sure, so I called the BI and he said 'No problem, as long as it's 8" (IIRC) below the sill'. I went to get the layout done and the cabs ordered and the designer refused to draw it that way because "You can't have stoves under windows. It's code". We went round and round. Eventually I just went with another cab company.The important part of this is the distance between the microwave or range hood and the range here code is 18".

No straight through path for sound waves.

Insulation will help after you have established a break between wall and/or ceilings.

It takes more than RC channel.Are you really asking about what you can do when you only have access from below? If you have access from above you can put an acoustic underlayment under the finish floor.

Otherwise, your plan is pretty much the deal. Don't use recessed lights; re-configure your HVAC ducting; seal/caulk all holes; add mass by doubling up on the drywall.- BobLead sheet attached to the bottom of the floor joists.

The guys over at AVS forums say there is a bunch of research out there that is finding spray foam is a bad idea if sound is your conceren. If you do cans you should build boxes around them out of wood or fiberglass duct board and seal all holes to give a barrier for sound.

Run the flex in a lazy s shape really helps.The Following User Says Thank You to Inner10 For This Useful Post: Leo GA complete disconnect is the best solution for eliminating sound transmission. lf your existing ceiling height is tall enough, just frame a room inside the room, ceilings included. 
If height is an issue, frame the walls an inch or so lower than the existing joists, and install the new ceiling framing between the existing joists. 

Pack it all full of Roxul. Foam sucks. Lots of mass on the walls... I have an architect that likes to spec 3/4" particle board, 1/2" homasote, and two layers of drywall with green glue. Skip the particle board on ceilings. 

I get calls for soundproofing all the time, and homeowners always have some grand plan about making their man-cave dead quiet.... until they see what it costs. 
Then it usually winds up being roxul-homasote-and double layer drywall with green glue on existing framing. Miserable work, but pays pretty well.- Alex :thumbsup:

It was built in the 1950's, in an uncorporated part of the county. Even by those standards, it's not very sturdy construction for around here. Here's an exterior wall. No sheathing of any kind, not even let-in bracing; the shear strength comes from the stucco on the other side of that paper.- BobAn electrician's been in there, permitted, too. That's a dozen or so 2-1 and 3-1 NM cables running through that chop in the stud.- BobHe set up some temporary power:- BobThe interior T&G and the T&G outside are the same. The upper roof surface is about 3" from the bottom of the T&G. I think there are just flat 2x4 sleepers between the T&G and the roof sheathing.- BobThese beams are the ceiling joists. It's a flat roof, with these beams about every 6 feet, then the T&G, then 2x4 sleepers (I think), then roof sheathing and membrane. Probably shims to establish some slope, but I didn't get that far. Note the connections at the end. I've never seen that setup; not necessarily a big problem, as there's not much weight above.- BobThe water heater with some fine flue work.- BobI'm not sure anything will come of it, but it was interesting to check it out. On the way back I got stuck in a monster traffic jam on the Bay Bridge. After a long wait I got past a couple of smashed-up police vehicles on the exit to Treasure Island. 5 hours later they were still looking for someone who bailed at the end of a chase and shot at the police.

Anyway, if I get involved in the remodel I'll post some more. I'm not counting on it, as something's funny about the situation.- BobDid you some how inherit this mess?????

If you are really worried about it , you can just take some aluminum coil and make your own starter strips , not that hard to do. 

Personally I would not be to worried about it. Could always use a tape to cover the edge too.The steel would be the donor in the galvanic reaction but with the small amount of moisture it's not a likely issue.

Randy's tape suggestion is also a simple precaution.

After removing thousands of squares of roofing with steel nails through aluminum drip edge, my experience suggests it's a very minor concern. I have seen steels nails almost completely dissolved in aluminum roof flashing, but only at drainage points where liquid water was a common occurrence.Above all, a good roofI need to bust out a section of the concrete basement slab on a house built in 1903. It's right next to the poured foundation wall. Do you think I'll encounter a footer?You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.Is the foundation original? Most houses around here were build post and beam with no foundation from what I can tell. The ones with an older original looking foundation are a jumble of river rocks and cement, usually settling in random spots.

Probably a crapshoot at best as to what you will run into.It's a 1903 poured basement wall? Most of the houses around here were some type of block basement... My house is 1919 and has clay CMU blocks.From what I've seen, this is regional. If it didn't have a footer, chances are it has settled. 

Around here, it would most likely be some big flat rocks.

I also see a lot around here that had cement poured against the original wall (usually rock) after the wall started moving, but you can tell that pretty easily from the wall thickness.It was really common around here for them to dig a hole, lay up block walls and then pour a slab. On homes around here from 1900-1930's more often than not there is not a footing. Surprisingly minimal settling, usually the structural issues i see have more to do with over spanned lumber. My Dad's 1936 home has 2x4 rafters.On homes of that vintage around here, we rarely find a real footing.

I am lucky to not really have any issues with water getting in, however i will be putting a sump pump in just in case. Anyways, plan was to use either 3/4 inch or 1 inch rigid foam on the floor with taped seams, and 1 inch sleepers on top. I've researched and heard this is a great way to do a floor, and would maybe only need a vapor barrier if i use the 3/4 inch. However im wondering what if i put something really heavy down there? Maybe weight and exercise equipment? I know the foam has a good compression rating but i dont think it could handle that or a pool table. Should i attach the PT sleepers to the slab and foam board between them? Should i use a vapor barrier since the sleepers would be attached to the slab? Any input would be appreciated.

Thanks bud, think ill do the vapor barrier, the sleepers attached to the slab, and the foam board in between. Any suggestions as far as the french drain? Ill be using 2 inch foam board on the walls, should i bring it all the way down so it sits over top the french drain kind of enclosing the channel? Or should i leave a bigger gap? Hopefully my question makes sense.I'm remodeling a basement bathroom. Completely changed the layout and added a shower, so I jack hammered a small amount of the slab out, managed to only have to take out about 5 square feet. I removed the existing vinyl floor as well in prep for self-leveler and tile.

Part of the new plumbing includes a backwater valve about 12" below the slab, which is accessible through a hole I formed into the slab. It's dry down there. Also dry in the hole where the shower drain is. Under the slab is extremely course sand that water would flow right through, and under that is silt/clay.

Just a couple feet away, a small amount of water is coming in/up at the slab/wall junction. House is on a hill and at this point the slab is only about 2' below grade.

Why do you suppose this happened? Vinyl was holding it out? Busting the slab a few feet away made an unseen crack? Finally, what should I do?You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.use dye backs in the water and sewer lines in the bathroom to see if is comen from thereGood idea but I know it's rainwater.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.Ouch. Maybe the vinyl was hiding it, or maybe the hammering opened a crack. How big is the crack? How much water? Is it the uphill or downhill edge of the slab?- BobI see you're having similar issues.

I don't really see a crack. It's the uphill edge. Only enough water to flow a couple feet away. According to HO, there is new drainage on the exterior of the foundation. The grading was improved but at this point only, it slopes toward the foundation. It's a difficult area to improve the grade, but we'll see what we can do. Possible will dig down to footing and waterproof foundation also.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.I'm always skeptical of "first time" leaks. They occur amazingly often when I'm starting to work on a project. The new drainage and grading improvements also indicate that this may have been an ongoing problem.

If the crack is the only problem area then you can probably cut it to key in some sealant. If water is forcing it's way up from the wall/slab joint I don't see how waterproofing the wall is going to help.Jaws;1780140 said:

It's not the answer to your exact question, but when it comes to cracks, cold joints, pipe penetrations and so on, I highly recommend the Adeka products, including the P-201, which comes in caulk form.- Bobbrock white has a product that you pour on the wall and floor that seals it

Also maybe no footing drain, I read the code as saying a well drainable fill is exempt from a dedicated drainage system. Maybe pipe the side taking the water and steer it away out the sides.Golden view said:

"Why most partnerships fail"

He's saying the same things about you.An old framer once told me "For years I thought I was the best damn carpenter in California. Come to find out I'm just competent."I just got out of a deal somewhat like this. Was suppose to take the expenses out and split the rest. I always ended up putting in more hours on a job. Which meant working for less for me. Only way would ever think about doing it again is on a job by job. Then on a flexible percentage.Most of the working partnerships that I've seen that involve essentially separate businesses cooperating together involve a sales commission. It's inevitable that one of the partners will sell more and, from what I've seen, the other partner tends to sell less and less as they see that the other partner will keep them fed. 

I don't like the idea of setting up commissions based on net profit because, while it seems fair, it's easy for a properly sold job to be mismanaged and then the salesperson takes a hit.Jaws;1780140 said:

I'll knock on wood for you. That seems like a rare good situation.- BobI am also in one of those lucky rare partnerships. My partner and I have a great company and have worked together for over 17 years. It works for us and I am very happy. We did have a third partner year ago and that did not work..lol.

If your partner is not pulling his weight I would have a heart to heart with him and let him know your concern. Communication is huge in any partnership.It is what it is...now fix it.:whistlingTime for a talk.I work often with another contractor. Whoever gets and runs the job gets 60% of what is left after all time and expenses are accounted for. If the job is a fail then they loose 60% on the other side. 

It is great. No ego. Whoever gets and runs the job gets to make the decisions. Got to find the right person.I'm kind of in the same situation. We have kind of an unspoken partnership and we profit share on everything. He's a rare person though and not many around here would do that, I'm fortunate. He's also taught me a ton on the side that I didn't have a lot of experience so I'm growing stronger due to our collaboration. It's really the way it should be, but most people are blind to the short term dollar and can't imagine sharing with someone.

Click to expand...Just throwing this up here because I know that everybody likes to see interesting projects. Bid on a porch "repair" on the back of a Section 8 apartment complex. Manager wants to repair and "make safe" so that he can get the city off his back and sell the property. I bid high with the caveat that lots of wood needs to be replaced and that the structure probably wasn't built to code originally so may need to be updated. Most of the structural components appear to be 2x6 and 4x6 which far exceed their rated spans. Columns are 4x4 cased in 1x6. Either way, lots of labor and logistical/bracing issues to complete. I'm guessing that my bid will be too high due to the prevalence of cheap labor in the city. Enjoy.:thumbup:Looks pretty nice for Section 8...I suppose you could say that. It was raining so I suppose that moved a lot of the "activities" indoorsThat would be a waste of time/money to repair... replacing it is really the only option...Well it seemed to be a borderline slumlord situation. I totally agree that tear off and replacement is the way to go. In fact that was the first thing I mentioned was how much easier it would be to start from scratch. No go on that. My bid definitely reflected the liability and hassle of wrestling a myriad of code infractions that would undoubtedly surface in the course of the repair. I'll have to find the picture but the decks themselves are composed of single 2x6x16 joists with no stiffeners (not that it would make a huge difference). Scary stuff. Kind of feel for the people living there because there seemed to be a lot of kids toys laying around the yard so you know they're out climbing all over it etc.I once gave an apartment owner a bid to replace a balcony similar to that situation. 

He said, "I don't want to replace it, just repair it". 

"No problem. I won't charge any extra to repair it. Same price"

I think he thought I was screwing with him.-JohnSee I need to get on here BEFORE I bid so I collect all of these witty come backs to use.I would charge more to repair than replace. So it's either replace or call someone else.I am doing a bathroom remodel in a clients home that asked me to take a look at their 2nd home for a possible water/mold problem in their newly finished basement. I tore out some built ins and cabinets and found that the sump pump was buried under the cabinets. The bottom of the cabinets are all moldy. I went a little further and pulled up 2 pieces of plywood on the floor and more mold. The contractor used wolmanized 2x4s laid flat with shims to "level" the concrete floor.

There will definitely be future mold issues unless everything gets redone. Looks like someone did a nice hack job on that basement. Is the entire basement floor was done the same way... on sleepers? Or just the portion under the cabinets?I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​You don't want to own that problem. Since they have weeping membrane, they have seepage, water and moisture issues. If it's covered up again, mold will be quick to follow. It needs breathing room. Maybe offer a floor tear out, and seal, paint or tile it or something.Entire floor is on sleepers like this. They probably have about 60k in the basement and its 8 months old. I wish there was better news for them but I'm afraid if lets say, I get the water issue on the wall resolved and everything put back together and they start getting that moldy musty smell from the floor in 2,3,4,5 years down the road I'll be liable. They have contacted the other contractors insurance company to come in and inspect it. I'm hoping the insurance company will agree that the floor was done wrong and pay to have it fixed correctly.The whole floor issue aside, I'm curious, was there access to the sump pit from inside that cabinet? If not, what was that previous contractor thinking by covering it up? What happens when the pump goes out?!?

Easy question. "Out of sight, out of mind, cash the check, see ya."There was "access". Unscrew an interior panel - remove the battery and wiring - unscrew the floor of the cabinet - figure out how to get it up and out (so tight I bashed it out) then figure out how to access the bolts to the lid and figure out how to get it out (again you'd have to bash the cabinets. We took it out to remove. The cabinet was smaller than the hole. And to boot it was melamine and mdf combo. Had mold and swelled completely.Eric K said:

Easy access with a "persuader".

(sledgehammer)Unfortunately - a mess

These are the times when homeowners find out they've been screwed by another builder. It's not YOUR fault! Don't forget that. You're there to fix the problem, not postpone the inevitable, or sidestep the problem. 
Tell them the proper way to fix it. IT's up to the homeowner to chase the other guy, maybe sue him, or try to get a claim from their insurance or whatever. 
I recommend the high road no matter what. Tell them it has to be ripped out, and redone properly. You can have other experts provide recommendations for you to help you decide the best way to tackle it if you need more advise.Eric K said:

Here's my situation.

Got a call about a bathroom remodel. Went to check it out and it looks like a great, simple project. For the most part....

Part of the remodel involves removing an old built in tub in a shower/tub combo. The walls are just painted lathe and plaster... no tile or wall liner of any kind, right down to the tub. This is the client's only shower, they use it every day, and have had no mould problems.

When we remove the tub, we will obviously be cutting a portion of the plaster away to remove the tub and install a new one. We will also be doing some damage to the wall with all the plumbing fixtures are in. I have suggested installing tile as the new tub surround so we can properly patch the damage with a product like densshield, then waterproof and tile over everything. The client absolutely loves the look of the bare painted plaster walls and does not want to tile the tub surround and would prefer us to somehow keep the look the tub/shower has now.

I've been a journeyman carpenter for 10 years... and I don't think I've ever seen a tub or shower that wasn't lined with something. It seems like an absolute disaster for water damage. Before I flat out refuse to do it, is there any way of achieving this look properly? I'm relatively young and wasn't around during the lathe and plaster days, so there may be some old tricks or advice i could use.Get a plasterer with experience in portland cement plasters and hydraulic lime plasters to come look at it and tell you what the existing is, and get a price to patch or replace it. Then mark up that price and include it in your total price to the homeowner.

If I were quoting an hydraulic lime plaster surround in my market, it would be in the range of $100/square foot, i.e. close to $10K for a simple surround, and I would qualify the customer on price before getting into the details.- BobVanIsle said:

I called a few plaster people to pick their brains, and even they said it was a bad idea. Thankfully this news, along with the helpful replies here, helped convince the client to tile the area.

Thanks everyone!Just because...

I hear that every once in a while and I cringe. Just because- someone's done something a certain way, doesn't automatically mean they have to do it that way again. 
When the plaster was installed on day 1 and sealed, it was a continuous application, and sealed the same way, so it had a good chance to be sealed. But starting in and trying to match something with a 'close' approximation is a recipe.... for disaster. It will leak, it will cause a problem, and you my friend, will be on the hook for it.
Convince them to rip out the rest of the lathe and plaster and do it right, or walk away. Just saying.I bought a house that the previous homeowners had a leak in a supply line under the vanity sink that they let go for a long time and eventually rotted the subfloor and the girder beam right under it. I can see the girder beam sagging underneath and it's taking the load bearing wall down with it above. When I go into the bathroom above I can put a 4 foot level across the ceiling and I have gaps on both ends as well to further verify this point. The portion of girder underneath that needs to be replaced is only about 6 feet from pier to pier.

The question is, how do I support the load bearing wall while removing the girder beam that is holding it up? Is there a way to support it from the attic? I know I will have to raise it anyway because as I said the sagging bowed girder underneath has taken the wall down with it and I need to raise it to get the new girder in anyway. It is a very small bathroom. The joist are in pretty good shape too. Its just that girder and about a 3 foot diameter of subfloor. 

Thanks for any help. I have to do this myself I cant afford to pay help.I am not a structure guy, but when I have had to repair sagging structure in the past I grab small floor jack or two, some lumber and jack that shi up where I want it."A smart man learns from his mistakes; a wise man learns from the mistakes of others."

We apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused. This thread has been closed.I just went over a foreclosure property with an investor (rental or flip). I'll be setting a reno budget so the purchase offer can be in the right ball park. I couldn't get into the attic, but It wasn't winterized correctly, so plumbing is popped (usual case), no furnace, old electrical, some structural problems, needs new roof and siding all around, yada yada yada. Smells like cat pee. Refrigerator is unplugged and full of food.

The good thing is the interior is wood paneling over wood paneling - no paint, so no RRP. Exterior is viinyl over something like MDF that has turned to mush, so no RRP on the outside, either. It's a little over 1000 sq ft 2bdrm with detached one car garage.

Not a gut. New windows, mostly new flooring, insulation, complete bath reno, minor kitchen reno, outside envelope including sheathing and vinyl, new roof system. At least some foundation work.

All new plumbing, electrical, heating systems.

Town office says no permits pulled since installing a furnace in 1978, so most of the plumbing and electrical work over the years wasn't inspected, and it looks it... It's on town water, but not town sewer. The septic tank and leach field are potential issues, but if they need replaced, it's cheaper to hook it to town sewer.And some structural (besides foundation).

Yup. You know your biz.Interesting development - nobody is allowed to even peek in the attic due to liability. First I've ever had this come up, and I've checked out lot of attics in 45 years.

Probably some of you run into some of the same things, but this is a town that had a bunch of mills in 1940, when the house was built. People would use whatever was cheap - sometimes that was a mill product that was a reject, but a lot of times it was whatever was left over from some mill project. Or in some cases, it was "inventory shrinkage". When I was a kid, you could look around after a mill was painted, and see houses getting the same paint job. Over by the Navy base, you might see some battleship gray houses. I mentioned in another thread a house that was owned and replumbed by a pipe fitter that worked at a shipyard - all short pieces of brass pipe with brass fittings...

Boiler insulation used to be nice fluffy asbestos that was mixed with cement and hand applied to various surfaces. It's entirely possible someone got a great deal on this fluffy insulation and filled the attic with it... If it wasn't tested, there would be no disclosure other than the house may have asbestos, and you'd only get that at closing.

Conceptually, this was a complete exterior and roofing system redo, with the interior being a lipstick. The exception on the interior was the bath - it's right where the foundation had failed, so the floor is very unlevel and soft, and it was totally screwed up to begin with so that's the one room that would be a gut. Unfortunately, there's no way to make a significant offer that includes asbestos remediation plus any other issues that couldn't be seen except from the attic. Every single ceiling would have to likely have be taken out to really get the remediation right for the long term.

That pretty much puts this in the walk category - there just isn't enough potential money to be made to make up for the added risk.

It's somewhat telling that the agent that shows this property didn't know attic access isn't allowed - could be someone at the brokerage knows something, and she's kept in the dark - she's only legally required to tell stuff she knows....New twist = $5k offer....hdavis said:

That's actually how it turned out. Before putting an offer in, the investor wanted to see a copy of the deed to see if heavy equipment could be brought on site with the building still standing. Meanwhile, someone paid too much, and it's under contract. Or, at least they plan to.

I was able to see the attic - 2X4 rafters and ceiling joists on a 4/12 pitch 24 foot span - no eave vents at all. These were site built similar to attic trusses.I've done a fair amount of old house restoration but I guess I've always gotten lucky when it comes it comes to using the existing joists to carry my new subfloor (then the original subfloor gets pulled, milled, and finished as flooring). 

In my own "new" house, built in 1875, I need to add a joist in the living room before I can put down Advantech. The other option is pulling down the bathroom wall and replacing subfloor in two rooms at once...but it's our only bathroom for the next year or two.

I have old, true 2"x6" joists spanning 12' on the first floor and 14' on the second floor. I'll need to rob all the original subfloor in the house in order have enough material to lay restored original material throughout the home. One obvious benefit to replacing all this original subfloor is that I'll be able to stiffen things up and eliminate a fair number of old house squeaks as I go. 

I'm hoping for a graceful solution, like an engineered 6" product. It's an old house so I'm not worried about deflection, I just don't want to throw an oversized joist in that bay and never be able to rock the basement lid. 

Who's done this before? Any ideas?Rip a 2x8 to dimension.Or just throw a modern 2x in there and fir it down in the future. Pretty simple stuff.griz said:

Not enough headroom to spare, unfortunately. In the basement, which was added in the 80's, I have 6'8" from floor to bottom of joist currently. 

If I dropped the ceiling more than an inch my brother wouldn't be able to stand up in my eventual man cave when he comes to visit.I put 2x8's in mine sistered to the original 2x6 and also used the extra height to level things out as well as stiffen things up.Agility said:

So double 'em up and they'll be significantly less bouncy.If you're just sistering on one, use a modern 2X6. If you're putting one in stand alone, use a modern 2X6 and shim under it to get the right height. Alternately, you can put it in and shim over it, but it's more work.

Without seeing your exact situation, the reason why ripping a 2X8 to exact width may not work is you may not be able to sledge it into place. Using the 5 1/2" modern one gives you clearance to get it positioned exactly where you need it without jacking, sledging, hammering, or prying.Replacing one joist, and you have basement access?

1875, so this was balloon framed. The end of the joist at the foundation level was usually set into a pocket on the outside wall, and over a beam on the inside. To get the stiffness, you'll need to double modern 2X6s. The end will have to slide over the beam, then into the outside pocket, but these aren't full depth if they're into a wood sill. You'll have to use a hanger as well, if that's how it is. Shim under both ends.Tinstaafl said:

No worries. My middle name is overthinking.Natural/modern 2x is good, LVL will be better with no shrinkage. I have also beefed up over spans by gluing 3/4 cdx on each side of the center of beams.

You just about hit the nail on the head. But my joists are in pockets on the outside wall and the interior beam.

And also I'm adding a joist, not replacing one. I need somewhere for my subfloor to land, otherwise I'd have to start gutting another room. Hoping to go one room and a time.You can notch 1/4 the depth on the bearing ends. Can you combine the lumber difference of the old wood with a notched 2x8? Not ripped....set it up where the advantech runs over the T&G sub floor coming from the bath side. Make a threshold at the door.

Special ordering a dozen true 2x6 like the original is not a bad idea at all either. Blocking and glue will be needed to make up the lost strength of the original T&G fir. I assume thats is what you have.Agility said:

Like griz said, flitch, using ply or steel.

Steel flitch plate assemblies with tight blocking really make nice solid floor framing in older homes with overspanned lumber - I've used that solution a few times.

You can make your own, or order premade as in this article:

Slight change in plans. I pulled the carpet and the 80's wood flooring it was laid on and found that on the offending side of the room the particle board was laid on shims on the original subfloor. Tall shims. 

Here is a cross section of the adjacent room, taken from the basement staircase. I cut it out when I realized what was going on. 









From bottom to top: true 2x6, original subfloor, ripped modern 2x shim, particle board subfloor, drywall.

It seems as if I've been talking people out of hiring me to work on their homes. I went to look at a little bit of work in a kitchen, and discovered a full gut remodel going on, throughout the entire home.

Plenty of things that didn't make sense to me, including that I was meeting the designer, and the general contractor should have been the one calling me. Now, generally speaking, I don't work for generals, so that probably would have been the end of it.

Anyway, it was a full kitchen gut (sound familiar), which then extended to the living room. The GC had run into a maze of electrical issues, so they called me in. 

It all worked out through. I did a lot of extra low voltage work, additional electrical. Plus these folks will still call me to do work at the house at a good rate.

My guess, though I didn't stick around to find out, was that there was some sort of disagreement between general and designer.

www.gebcon.comI am working on a slab on grade rambler in the fridgid Minnesota. I am looking for input on how to keep the slab from sucking all the heat out of the house in winter.Uh...where does one begin with answering such a general question?

I know...what do the plans call out for?

Andy.https://andytardif.wixsite.com/websiteIt is a bit vague??The house is gutted right now. Slab on grade is not very common around here and I am unsure if carpet pad will be enough to prevent cold carpet. Just wondering about the various products that are out there, if any, other than polystyrene.Dig down & insulate the foundation - beyond that good luck 
Pad will help, the thicker & higher the quality the betterSLS Construction & Building Solutions LLC Our Blog - The HTRCThe polystyrene will work if you run it from the frost line up the foundation wall to the top of the concrete. Won't work well though. If termites are an issue there, they love the foam. They don't eat it, it just makes a nice way for them to tunnel into the home from outside.

There are better ways to do this but it requires being installed prior to the installation of the slab.Patriotism is being loyal to your country all the time and your government when it deserves it. Mark TwainIf you're just looking for interior fix, the XPS with a floating platform of two layers plywood laid in opposing directions glued and screwed will work. The two layers prevent prevent the "potato chip" effect of having just one. This is what's done sometimes around here for basement slabs that were never insulated. If this is the first floor of a multi-story building though, you'd probably run into code problems for stair risers. Not sure what your HDD are, but 2" should suffice for vapour barrier. Without more details it's difficult to provide guidance. 

Exterior wise, CMHC has a good guide book for determining horizontal skirting insulation

how to keep the slab from sucking all the heat out of the house in winter.

Click to expand...

Insulation or magic.NY Times...."Prison Population Growing Although Crime Rate Drops..."There are insulated floor tiles available for that purpose. I can't remember what they are called but you can get them through Home Depot. They are made in Canada, the Canadians got it down on dealing with cold climates.Grand parents had a slab on grad ranch in SE WI. Failry unusual there too for a residence. ALso worked work at a church across the street. The rectory was a 2 story slab on grade.

Not that bad really. About the only thing you can do after the fact is insulate the exterior of the footing with sheet insulation. 18-24" deep most likely. This will keep the real cold and frozen ground from sucking heat away from the edges of the slab. The interior generally does a decent job of mainting temp. Not much different than an un-heated basement.

Carpet and pad work to take the edge off a cool slab and insulate a bit.Jaja Wazak always said nothing good ever come from CanadaPut 2x4 sleepers on the flat and fill the bays with closed cell insulation. 3/4" plywood over that for the win.The only other thing I have used here in WI, provided stairs are not an issue, is to install a ditra type product. Firm plastic that provides an air space/thermal break between slab and plywood floor. They also have 2x2 osb tiles with a plastic sleepers laminated to the back. Good luckMy house is on a slab in NE MO.Single digits & below zero are not uncommon temps. 2x4 walls, so I'm assuing r13 insulation at best. House heats really well. Once the concrete is warm, it stays warm. Cools well in the summer too.Thanks fellas. I'm thinking the most realistic option is cork or some other type of insulating underlayment.

http://www.freshdecks.caNot sure this is the correct place for this.

Doing a reno/addition and need to dig 5 3'x3'x16" footings in the basement. Concrete saw with irrigation and jack hammer to get thru the slab, and then dig the dirt. Nothing new.

My problem is that the only ventilation is three small basement windows. The irrigation will help keep the dust down, but I don't know how well. I was looking for some kind of air intake and dust removal system to rent, but have come up empty.

Anyone with any experience with this kind of thing have any advice?United rental in NJ has air scrubbers, not cheap. " Build clean" is also a small product some guys have been buying for about a 1kElectric saw, I hope? A gas one will have you gagging before the first hole's done.

Dust is practically zero with any half decent wetsaw. You'll get much more from the jackhammer, but manageable. Hang a tarp "tent" from the joists and you'll contain 80-90% of it. For the rest, stick a good box fan in one of those windows blowing outward, and leave the others open to let fresh air in.Tashler said:

You may want at least six air changes per hour. 
How big's the basement, how big the windows?

If you find a fan strong enough that works with the windows then fan noise may be a problem.

Grainger tech help may have some rules of thumb for this.

I stand corrected:

"The GuardianR can deliver up to 500 CFM. . .
will provide four air changes per hour (the recommended minimum) on 7,500 cubic feet (more than a 30' x 30' x 8'′ room). "

but you really need to see the fan curve to see how this will do with small windows for air intakes.You can pick up a brand new air scrubber for about 1k from Jondon-our customers absolutely love them but admittedly we charge $70 per day to insurance carriers on insurance based jobs.

If you don't see yourself using it in the future just pick one up from local rental co. and it will do the job-


www.builtrestoration.comwww.builtrestoration.comI like the tent idea and you could buy a negative air fan with a sock on it like harbor freight under 100 direct it to the windowSearched United Rental last night and again just now. Nothing for air scrubber or air filtration.

Was actually thinking of, with reservations, using the gas down there with fans. Probably not the best idea, but sometimes I learn from my mistakes.

Buying a $1000 air scrubber isn't going to happen. I might buy a DeWalt tile saw for $800 that I'll use a few times a year, maybe. Can't spend $1000 for a tool I probably won't use again.

Basement is 24x36, windows are 14" x 24". Not worried about containing the dust as upstairs is getting gutted.

Worth it.Really sounds to me like you're overthinking it, especially since the place is getting gutted. I've done similar cuts with no air exchange at all available--not pleasant, but still manageable with an electric saw.

Let us know how it plays out. :thumbsup:I over think everything. I'd rather sweat it now than find out I'm not doing something right or well or endangering us. Don't want to start and then find out that we need air equipment, which I figured I would.Tashler said:

24x36x8x(>4ACH) = >28,000 cu ft per hour = >460 CFM.

If the air comes in the windows and goes up the stairs you don't need filters.

The fan blade swept area A should be <1/4th of the total window intake area and A = PI x [(blade dia)^2]/4. Window area = 14x24x3 = 1000 in^2, so blade dia = <sqrt[4x1000/PI] = <36". 

Forcing air out the windows with at least one fan may be better than trying to suck air into them. In that case block the unused windows so the fresh air is routed down from upstairs.

If the masks the workers wear don't get dirty the air can't be too dirty.Use an electric saw with a diamond blade, a helper douching it with a small stream of water and sucking the slurry up with a shop vac and a squeegee attachment.....Anybody have any feedback on the "Dust muzzle" for skilsaw?

Unless it has a center drain and you're standing on the drain, then you're standing on a slope. '

I've built linear drain showers and used the pre-sloped mats (which are fantastic) and I couldn't feel the slope just standing there.

yupsmoke damage in a fire is typically a very acidic smoke and can be removed by using a very alkaline cleaner such as a heavy duty industrial de-greaser. home depot has some heavy duty concrete de-greaser, ive used it on brick around windows and it works pretty well for not being an actual smoke eater type product.

I'm thinking the screwed version would be easier to replace and hold better.Screwed no matter what, aluminum/metal would be best.Jaja Wazak always said nothing good ever come from CanadaI think the commercial version that a retaining plate is screwed on and the guard clips on is the way to go. They come in all kinds of colors and styles.I looked at those, but I was thinking of something with a lower profile.

Who knows though.

I did this in my last house. When I used to help my x's step dad lay tile we would have to build the niche and now they have pre made stainless inserts you just stick in the wall and tile over. Makes a nice spot to put bath products. Take the tile all the way to the ceiling. Use bull nose tile around the edges and run it all the way to the floor on both sides of the tub to cover up the flanges of the tub. Looks nice in my opinion, its the best, short of a walk in with glass doors and a seat in the shower. :thumbsup: Don't forget to post pics...Does that bathroom need a tub.

Big Shoe-Interested in finding out more about your receptacle in the drawer for the hair dryer. Sounds slick and never seen it done. Any pictures?It would depend upon what kind of tub you have in mind? Is this a master bath or just a kids bathroom with a standard 5' tub?
If it's a master and its a free standing tub, installing the tub after the tile would be better.Can anyone point to the section of the International Building Code that addresses exactly when modern code is enforced on an existing structure? I'm referring to structural code enforcement here - I realize different rules apply when talking about aspects such as electrical, plumbing, etc.

I have long understood that before a building inspector can enforce current code a building must be damaged (or otherwise reconstructed) by 50% or more.

Example: A garage is damaged by fire. If over 50% damage, the entire garage must comply with current code, which in older neighborhoods meant that it would be torn down because it no longer meets setbacks. If under 50% damage the garage could be repaired (the new sections typically having to meet current code).

But I've never actually looked it up - and I can't find it. I have looked in the IBC Existing Building Code manual and can't actually find the rule.

In SECTION 202 GENERAL DEFINITIONS there is the following: " SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. For the purpose of determining compliance with the flood provisions of this code, damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred."

But I can't find a place elsewhere in the code that mentions "substantial damage", or gives the building official authority to enforce current code.

Can anyone point me to the place?

Many thanks!
MikeIt was explained to me that once you demo it out of code, it needs to be built back to current code.Mike.
_______________I think you find what you are looking for in chapter 34 of the IBC.JAH said:



I think you find what you are looking for in chapter 34 of the IBC.

Click to expand...

Yes. Chapter 34 is pretty easy to follow. There's no such thing as a 50% rule. Depending on the case, you may have to replace with new if something was taken out of service (stairways, for example), or get an engineer's evaluation, or be able to show that the repaired structure will be no further out of compliance with current code than it was before (assuming that it was code compliant when it was built).

The idea that a local building official couldn't enforce code is pretty funny. In my experience, the "50% rule" is something used by city permit offices, to allow people to try to get away with stealth upgrades, very commonly to decks. 

Finally, your garage example surprises me - in many jurisdictions you could repair or replace that garage in the same location.- BobDo you have a current project or prospective project where this is a question? Post a few of the details, and maybe some members will be able to share some specific experience or knowledge.- Bobevery jurisdiction is different. 
if you tear something out and rebuild it, here in Chattanooga, tn you are required to at least meet minimum code. 

on renos, there isnt a 50% rule. If your contract amount exceeds 30% of the home value, the work (regardless of what it is) needs to meet current standards.

During a renovation that does not exceed 30% of the homes value if code violations are uncovered (structural, mechanical, electrical or plumbing), you are not allowed to leave them as is.Thanks for the replies. 

In the 2012 IBC Chapter 34 is Existing Structures (thanks for pointing JAH). In 2015, they very thoughtfully use Chapter 34 to refer us to the International Existing Buildings Code, having moved all the content to a separate manual (for good). My reference to 
Section 202 Definitions is from the 2015 Existing Structures Code. Just so everybody's on the same page. 

I agree, it does sound a bit funny to talk about an inspector not being able to enforce code - but actually that's precisely what is at the core of this: enforcing code or going unreasonably beyond it?

It's obvious that any enforcement official has legal limits on what they can impose, we all know they can't demand I place footings deeper than the legal requirement in my area (which is 42") for example. This is really the purpose served by the Code - local officials don't then have to make up their own set of rules. They take the Code and make local modifications, but even those are written - so everyone knows the rules.

That said, I do understand that there are areas of judgment call on the part of the inspector, but fortunately for all, those areas are the exception.

So for my literal example: A 100 year old garage has had a fire which damaged about 30% of the roof structure (being liberal). The local inspector has informed the owner that they will have to insert a 2x10 ridge beam into the existing undamaged roof - a requirement I don't believe he has the authority to back up with Code. 

I am surprised to hear you say there is no 50% rule. The quote in my first post alludes to a 50% rule but it's in reference to compliance with flood provisions. But not nearly as surprised as I am to hear you say that a structure that fails current zoning compliance could be rebuilt! You mean to say that in your area, if a garage built on the lot line burns down they will allow a new garage to be built in the same place?

And yes, over the years people have indeed done "stealth rebuilds" of everything from decks to garages. Actually not a very common occurrence though. However, one reason I wanted to see the rule for myself is that I suspect the officials have eventually done away with that 50% rule in its old form, updating it to something more restrictive.

My own writing here has made me realize that part of that 50% business is actually a zoning issue, so tomorrow I'll see what I can find in our zoning code. That business of not rebuilding in the same location is definitely a zoning issue. I suppose if we separate that, the "IBC vs. local inspector demands" issue then narrows down to that business I mentioned: Is he legal to demand that the customer go to the expense of inserting a 2x10 ridge into the undamaged section of roof?

Mark 122, your reply appeared after I posted this. No disagreement about complying with current code on any rebuilt sections. Your local code then demonstrates exactly what I'm talking about - in your case it's a 30% rule instead of 50%. But there's still a rule that guides all as to when you will be required to begin altering existing structure.Well we are guided by the rehab code with prohibited and non prohibited materials.
Here is some language similar to what your saying but it gets applied differently.

Click to expand...

I've done it, and I have a project in the works to do it again - to tear down an existing dilapidated garage and put a new one in the same place. A common requirement is that it has to be the same size, or at the very least that the encroachment into the setback can't be any larger.

It's a local planning code question. Begging works sometimes.- BobTom M, thanks for the interesting link to New Jersey Code. That introduction piece was amazingly easy reading! Granted they did say that it was strictly an introduction and not the code itself...

Here in Des Moines, Iowa, the municipal code is fairly brief, mostly referring to the IBC (which in turn refers to the International Existing Building Code for existing structures). 

CarpenterSFO, you're right about the "rebuild in same location" being a local planning question. As I mentioned, that particular constraint comes from our Zoning Code. Only around here, begging is useless. Across the board, our municipal officials here have drunk the Kool-Aid, and have doggedly pursued the suburban model ever since - utterly disregarding how little sense it usually makes in the context of the existing built environment. I'm glad to hear some places are more progressive. But then, I've known San Francisco to be more progressive the Des Moines for a little while now. 

So putting zoning issues aside, what do you gentlemen think of the inspector telling the homeowner that they'll have to insert a 2x10 ridge beam into the existing roof? I feel that he's overstepping his bounds.ExPro said:

Click to expand...

Was it built to code originally? Did code exist then? What is the insurance situation? Will it be a financial hardship to add the beam? Is there an alternative (a mid-ridge post up from the joists below?). What is the inspector's reason, exactly, and is he willing to put that reason in writing?

Basically, I'd work every other angle possible before trying to argue about whether he's overstepping his bounds.- BobCode officials do have authorization to make judgement calls. Specially if they think it's a safety thing. When they do, you can either follow or go the board of appeals.

Is it a gable? Can a new ridge board be placed under the existing? What's there now?Thanks gentlemen, I do appreciate your efforts, but I'm not new to the business. I don't disagree with any of your points; actually I did speak earlier to the fact that inspectors have a certain amount of leeway in making judgement calls. Although I would point out that asking an inspector to put his reasoning in writing IS challenging his authority.

I'll go ahead and give you more facts of the case, then we can close the discussion.

I don't know the insurance situation, and it's outside the confines of my original questioning (IE: I wanted to see if anyone had actually read somewhere in the IBC any language about a 50% replacement rule).

The building (garage) was indeed built before code, pre 1920, possibly pre 1900.

Yes, it's a gable, with a 1x6 ridge and 2x4 rafters. The garage is not more than 20 ft. across the face, so rafter runs are 10 ft. or less.

Yes of course inserting a 2x10 ridge into an existing roof is a financial hardship. You're only going to do it by one of two ways: to take the roof completely off and rebuild it, or to build temporary shoring walls under each half of the roof, remove sheathing along the ridge on both sides far enough down to allow good access, and very carefully cut back the rafter pairs just enough to allow the 2x10 ridge to be inserted. This is a kind of "surgery" that not everyone can do well, and I'm not the contractor.

In fact, the owner doesn't actually have a "contractor" and I'm not directly involved - yet! This has come to me indirectly because I live in the neighborhood and I know the owner (Alex). When I mentioned to our mutual contact that Alex might consider reading up on the code to see if perhaps he had some ground to stand on, I got a message back that Alex would like to talk to me.

Because local zoning rules historically have had a 50% replacement interpretation, and because you don't want to piss off an inspector who might throw a bigger book at you, I don't want to advise this neighbor to challenge the inspector unless I'm very sure we're standing on solid ground. What if rules have changed in the last few years and the inspector is actually holding back from the worst he could do (such as make them move the garage to current setbacks)?

So that's why I asked if anyone had actually read that kind of language in the IBC. In my 18 years in the remodeling business, I never actually read half of the stuff that everybody generally takes as common knowledge. But this is one situation where it will be well advised to know as exactly as possible just what is legal and what isn't - before having any conversation with the inspector.

Thanks for your input men, I do appreciate it.Got to find out what you administrative code reads for your state. Maybe the library.
As I linked, we ditched 50% rules and now use a rehab code with no limit on repairs.
Historical rules I'm not up on.i would advise your neighbor to look into his adjustment rather than fighting a loosing battle against the official

if a portion of his roof structure was compromised then his insurance should pay out to have the roof repaired as required, they have supplements that they can add to the original adjustment for code upgrades. he may need to submit a letter from the city showing this request.

building codes have been in place since before the early 1900's. none of them are still applicable to our standards now but they did have them.With a 1x6 ridge and 2x4 rafters Alex should consider himself lucky the inspector just wants the ridge beefed up. IMHO this is one of those situations where you just do whats asked. I would not want to get into a pissing match with an inspector over a undersized ridge in a small out building.If the rafters meet you don't even need a ridge. I believe 1x6 meets code for a 2x4 rafter.
Whats the pitch?Is there some reason your neighbor can't satisfy the requirement a different way? Provide another solution.- BobI recently pulled a fiberglass batt out of a wall cavity in a wall built 2 years ago. I noticed webby, blackish lumps of some type of bug refuse. In another area I saw the same thing, with about 15 ants around it. 

When I pulled it off, it didn't look like any of the wood was eaten or deteriorated. Some areas looks stained, maybe slightly moldy.

The ants were the very common, small ants I see a lot here.

Anyone know exactly what's going on and how serious it might be??My internet access is on this iPhone using web browser and it keeps giving me an error uploading a picture. Maybe I'll have to get the appMaybe camel crickets?
I tore out paneling from a garage a few years ago and it had been infested with these camel crickets. Black specs all over the place but no signs of any damage."We'll be fine"I have lots of them in my basement but there were no signs of them. Just common ants


Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkI agree, it's ants - trapped in spider web. I've seen them enough times before. If you have an electric panel anywhere in the vicinity, better pull the cover. For some reason they are often attracted to the magnetic field (or maybe just the 60 cycle hum). I have seen main panels with the bottom filled clear up with the debris - much of which is actually dead red ants (here anyway, they're very small).

The spiders are attracted to the easy prey. BTW spiders tend to build in strategic locations which have optimum prey potential - so spider webs are a good way to spot drafts!That makes a lot of sense. I found some strange seeds in the layers of fiberglass. The ants were moving them to store. 

I cleaned it out and caulked between the roof overhang and frieze board trim where they were coming in

http://stainlesssteelfilm.com/Satin-EZ-Faux-Stainless-Steel_c17.htmThe majority of nickel mined and/or used is in stainless steel.

Concerns about toxicity should limit the use of that stuff, right?

Moreover, if the toxicity of nickel is of great concern, wouldn't water fixtures cause greater health risks?

Next we'll have RRP for nickel.My personal opinion, based on this -

... would be that I personally wouldn't have any qualms about installing a nickel table top. What I read about in that note are acute toxic effects from ingesting gram-sized amounts of nickel compounds, and cancer from inhaling nickel dust in manufacturing environments, and no studies establishing chronic toxicity.

Your metal guy may be aware of the inhalation risks in a fabrication environment.

Probably worth looking into it more if you're concerned about it.

As accomplishments go, getting me to talk is an easy one.

Click to expand...i installed a kraft maid kitchen two years ago and the sink is on the island as shown in the picture. The problem is that from water splashing over the sink it runs down the back panel and is peeling the finish.
Kraft maid paid me to replace the panel two times now and sent out a finish repair guy once and now it is peeling again.

instead of me replacing the panel every six months i need to do something permanent. Thought of putting a piece of tempered glass on the back of the island behind the sink but that would be ugly. Also thought about having the granite company installing a granite back splash but the customer does not want that 

So i was thinking of leaving the two raised panels at either end and tiling the center 36" section behind the sink base with tile like i used on the back splash and bringing it out flush with the stiles on the raised panel section.
the customer likes that idea.

i was hoping to maybe get some other opinions and ideas on what else i could do there that would look nice and protect the panel from water.

thanks...............nicko"Quality work for those who know the difference"How much does the countertop overhang the cabinets in the back? New slab with a larger overhang. 
Or, maybe a saw kerf on the underside of the current counter to act as a capillary break? Water will end up on the floor instead of on the panel.

thanks J.C.
yes it should have had more over hang i think that would have gone a long way in preventing the problem but i let it up to the granite guys and that is what i got. as far as the saw kerf, i did think of that last year but there is not enough overhang for it to help.
Most of the peeling is on the bottom of the panel. When i installed the kitchen i scribed the panel tight to the floor and since that took the finish off the bottom edge that is where it started peeling. The first time i replaced it i left the factory finish wrap around the edge and left the panel off the floor about 3/16 and filled the gap with color matched silicone.

I thought that would take care of it but it peeled again. 

thanks.............nicko"Quality work for those who know the difference"Well, tell the client they need to stop being slobs. You can't leave standing water on a finished surface.

An option would be an inset shelf on either or both sides at the cavity height.... something like this but on smaller scale...








If it's one of these...








Then a shelf in between could work depending on depth of closet.

Or depending on woman's height and stackable height, a shelf above...








Depending on depth of closet and type of stackable, you could also mount a shelf to the back of the interior part of the door... Something like this, but on a smaller scale...








While the pump sounds cool, it has to be continually refilled and everytime they have to they will think of you...

Follow the path of least resistance... you might find that being able to simply put a bottle on a shelf is exactly that instead of adding steps to being able to use it... how to achieve it based on the above criteria (i.e. - dimensions, height, depth, bottle size, etc.) can be discussed with the info or pic...

Best of luck.... 8^)

.Thanks everyone for weighing in on my dilemma. At this point she's coming around to the idea of transferring her detergent to a smaller container of the same brand. 

I'm building in a small cubby to the right of the washer and dryer just on the inside of the door, similar to the second pic on Kap's post. The clearance between the appliances and the double door is 5/8 ....so you can see the trouble.

I have to lay some of the blame for this situation on the designer. In reviewing the drawings nothing is to scale. She had all kinds of room in the closet for everything you could ever want. Now I see why the HO was taken aback. 

Dang designers and dang me for not catching it and pointing it out.

Thanks again.....I still want to know if there's a dispenser that works!!!!Here ya go... :whistling:

MikeI have to re-laminate a counter top. I intend to simply re-apply the new laminate directly over the old. All is well adhered, so no issues with anything lifting. My question is, although this top is small, it is in three sections. Like those the sinks that we see at at 45 degree angle in a kitchen. The existing top has been laminated in three sections. I do not know the best way to cut the laminate to fit in that center section. This section is about 22'' wide and will require a perfect edge on both sides. How do you do this cut?

I could remove the counter top and use my new festool track saw to cut the entire top into three sections (Has no back splash) and simply recover with the new laminate, but i would think a better path exists. So I bring this question to the forum.trussme said:

I just ordered a new mica countertop for a customer, the kid put something hot on it and burned the surface. The counter was a corner 10' one way and 5 the other... The whole new top was under $300... if you have a small top it will cost you basicly nothing, because with the granite trend nobody is using this stuff as they did, and today this is dirt cheap... as a matter a fact its cheaper to have it made than waste your time doing it.I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​I would just replace the whole top. quicker, easier and no issues with bonding to the oldWe'll give your home a NEW IMAGE

FacebookEven the most experience with laminate, would avoid doing those seams as you describe.

1. Worse place to have a seam in a re-lam is over another. They just don't work well.

2. Requires a lot of work and ideally more specialized tools (and or techniques) than a track saw.

Use a whole sheet width and put the seams in the field of the legs.Jaja Wazak always said nothing good ever come from Canadajaydee said:

There are times when it is a great thing to learn the craftsmanship of things. There are also times when it pays to do the simple and quick thing. If it is for yourself, go for it. If it is for a customer, you will get a better product with a new countertop and probably make the same money when all is said and done.Clamp both sides of the join to a straightedge and run a router with a copy cutter across it. Piece of cake... done it plenty of times.FYI I'd still buy new tops:thumbsup:Looking at a job doing a fairly extensive makeover on a 1955 National Homes house. I'm familiar with the construction method with the pre-built panels. Is there anything special that I should be aware of when getting into gutting and renovation work? I assume that any structural work is done the same as on a stick built house? Hopefully somebody has some experience with these.I used to build modular stick built homes.One thing to be aware of is everything is glued.Drywall,subfloor,sheeting.We used PL400 and nails on everything.
One other thing.We used to nail all the floor up in a jig,pl400 and nail the subfloor then run any carpet or sheet vinly before setting the walls.So you may have flooring running under the walls.
Yours is 1955 and these were early 70's so I'm sure they may not be done the same.Just a heads up.I think I'm in the middle of one now myself. This one is all 2x3 and 2x2 framing. Making things a little more difficult.bkurzenb said:

No doubtthose are a different animal..These were modular but all built with 2X4'''s. You could even order them with 2x6 exterior walls and more insulation as an upgrade.
Funny we did'nt call things upgrades then.They were options.Cool thing about them was they were mostly a bath and a half which we called core panels.they were framed with 2x6 walls built back to back in a cube and all of the main electrical and plumbing were n these walls.All the vertical stuff.Stacks ,vent and main panel.Like another poster mentioned,the National homes I encountered were 2x3 " exterior walls,2x2" interior, 3/8 " plywood roof on 24" centers.Nothing you pick up can just be put in! The only question I have is, are the modulars built with truss systems or stuck framed rafter? The roof system looks like they were homemade truss but they also have a ridge board and spaced on 16oc?They were hinged rafters.they had to be able to move them to the site,lift the roof and add the ridge on site then fill in the gable ends.So these hinged rafter have what looks like a birds mouth in the rafter and the ceiling joists? I've just never seen anything like it before.Yeah .They have to attach the roof so they can lay flat during transport.Otherwise they would be to tall to go under bridges.After they set them on the foundation they raise them and tie everything together with a ridge beam then fill in the gable ends.
That's the way they did it at the place I worked in the early 70's.All of these houses went out in two or three sections.they were exactly like a stick framed house but we built everything flat on jigs.We would build the floors on a jig over railroad rails and wheels then start assembling things on top of that and roll it right down the line.
They employed 125 people and we would build 1.5 houses a day.worked on one four the last 4 months, bath remod, and added a room addition. they are junk ,cheap built junk. I will never work on one again. did I mention they are junk..:no:I agree with bob on this one but any ways i hope the home remodeling goes great.I used to live in one, but it wasn't a National home. It was built in 1958 and the company that built them were in South Bend IN. For the life of me, I can't remember the name of the company though. There were TONS of them built here in Indy.

Mine was all TRUE 2" x 4" exterior and interior walls (not 1.5" x 3.5"). There wasn't much insulation in the thing (ZERO in the walls). My dad and I tore some of the interior walls down to move things around and increase the size of the kitchen. They used a lot of 1/2" tongue and groove wainscoting in the thing as well. 

The roof decking was 1/2" plywood on trusses 24" on center. The other really bad thing I didn't like, was it had very wide 30" overhangs with 4" gutter boards, no gutters and no soffit vents. Only two gable vents to ventilate. 

Eventually, the overhangs started to rot. So I took them all down, cut all the rafter-tails back about 6" and ran new 6" gutter boards and gutters and then installed bead board in the soffits with proper ventilation.

So really, it wasn't a badly built house at all. Unless you looked at stuff like hollow core birch slab interior doors, crappy 2-1/4" ranch casing and a simple 1" x 2" as base molding. All of which I eventually changed. The other thing I really didn't care for was, it was on a slab and every house on the street was nearly identical inside.

But not after dad and I got done with mine.- John Williams

We changed our plan of attack and ended up doing mostly cosmetic work (doors, paint, etc) in addition to a complete re-wire. Apparently the home had been added onto at least twice and featured one outside panel box as well as two indoor ones. This made for a complete mess sorting out circuits since nothing was labeled in addition to the obvious problem of running to three different boxes when you trip a breaker. Everything was torn out and pulled to a new 200A service box with new wire run all the way to the meter. Customer is happy and I feel 1000x better walking away from the job.

I like that pattern better. Office building?- BobA while back I decided to start using steel framing where it made sense in remodels in our typical single family home work - type 5, wood frame. So far, for non-bearing walls, soffits, half-walls, etc. We've had to use it before in our high-rise condo remodels, and I thought I'd give it a shot in other types of projects.

In addition to its other advantages, I've been finding that remodeling crew with light framing experience do a much better job framing with steel than with wood. A few things (fire stopping, running electrical and plumbing, etc.) have required some learning, but I've been happy with it, feel that I've been delivering good value, and customers don't have any opinion about it at all.

We've been using 20-gauge to 14-gauge, and the result is rock solid.

The materials cost a bit more, but I'm not having a problem with that. In many cases we'd be using LVL's or other materials more expensive than dimensioned lumber, anyway.

I realize that steel is mundane for many in new construction or large projects - they load my few studs in between the truckloads going out to big projects - but I'm wondering how many are doing this in single family remodels? Anything to share? Any comments?- BobI'm interested as well. I've used steel on basement projects, but haven't done it other remodels. I honestly prefer working with steel since we do all the interior finishes as well. For me having straight/flat walls is easier to finish in all aspects. The higher cost of steel can be partially offset by improved finish quality and increased production on phases after framing.Remodeling Contractor Scranton PA

Scranton PA Kitchen RemodelingOne of the contractors I learned from said she used it all the time in the Oakland hills and sold it on the fire stopping merits. Seemed to work well there for obvious reasons.
Nice that it doesn't shrink. No nail pops, need to crown the studs, etc.I'm using it. I can carry more studs by myself than wood studs. I don't have to select for straightness, and it never splits. No hole drilling for wiring. 

The downside is I have to travel a ways to get the materials - too far away for small deliveries. I also have to make sure I have the right drywall screws with me - I still have buckets of the conventional ones.Pretty typical for us to use wood exterior bearing walls and light gauge interior walls on things like small offices, vet clinics, etc. I've used them on basement finishes. I actually like working with them more than wood.-JohnI started out working for a commercial steel stud and drywall company, mostly doing suspended ceilings but also got some framing experience with steel studs. I like them a lot for certain things. Things like soffits in basements are much easier to do with steel studs. I don't use them all the time but on certain jobs they are better to use over wood.I did a complete townhouse complex in Napa with steel studs about 98,000 sq.ft. and then a 40,000 sq.ft. retirement home in Sonoma as well, all steel.

Once the guys get screws over nails, grinder over skilsaw, etc. it's pretty simple to work with.ChrisNice to be able to cut a stack at a time without muscling around too much.-JohnI've been considering using it more for the same reasons.Most of the remodels and additions we do have a considerable amount of drywall and it would be nice for a solid flat wall .mako1 said:

You probably already know to find yourself a good commercial supplier, to get a heavier gauge than you will get from the big box stores. They also stock the fire stops, stiffeners, clips, and other useful pieces. Around here the big boxes only sell the studs, not the tracks, either.- BobThe BB strores around here don't even sell it.I have a good local lumberyard that supplies most of my material and does good quality at a good price.They will pretty much get me whatever I want the next day if they don't stock it.Lucky to have them in a small town.
When I was in Florida doing high rise condos that is all they used so I'm a bit familiar with it just never used it in residential but with the quality of wood these days and the pros with the metal framing .I think I'll try it and see what happens.If it's just going to be sheet rocked and maybe a few door's and some base molding then yea I'm using metal .

That would have been my guess. I know some that like to put ply up on walls before rocking so cabinets can be fastened anywhere, even with wood framing...In California we always bought our fasteners for drywall, cabinets etc for steel from ORCO, which if I remember was bought out by WhiteCap.

Fasteners made by Grabber, use the LOX head...you will be impressedChrisI just find it annoying trying to fasten crown to metal framing . When you have a ceiling that's not straight and your fighting to push the crown in place I would like to grab my gun and shoot a few fasteners to hold it in place . When you need to use a screw gun to install crown that's unproductive and the time you saved by using metal was not worth it . I'm also not installing cabinet's to metal with out first putting up a few sheet's of plywood , but then you need to install sheet rock over it . I'm not concerned with wood not being straight , that's what shim's are for .
I'm also curious to know how some of you are installing crown with metal stud's .Typically either wood blocking at the studs or a triangle ripped nailer behind the crown. Some guys just cross nail and glue it. We have a nail gun that works for baseboard in to 26-24 gauge.-JohnET&F makes a 'T' shaped nail and air gun designed for trim work into these studsChrisis it possible to replace a fiberglass pan from above if the dimensions of the drain are identical?

after finding a couple of options online, what type of drains have you found to be of good fit and quality? Do the types with the expanding gasket fail in the future?If by "from above" you mean you don't have access to the p-trap from below, that's not a problem. The caulkless/compression drain flange like Oatey work great and I've never seen a failed gasket after having pulled many older ones.

And that is a definite....I've already been through that conversation...about the limited number of call backs!TEXAS Born, TEXAS Bred, When I Die, I'll be TEXAS DeadI have a question for you seasoned contractors out there. It is a question about training new hires. I am talking about apprentices who have very little experience with anything construction. First I must provide a little background. I operate a small business with my father. For a while we had but one employee. She worked with us for almost a year before she was laid off for essentially not being productive enough. Since she moved on we have been operating the business with just the two of us. My father got me started in this industry but I would say that I have learned 90% of what I know from information I've gathered from books and the internet, and hands on trial and error. I have become very self sufficient as far as training goes to the point that I have become a sponge for anything related to the work. I learn just from being around the stuff. Recently our work load has been growing and we need to hire more people. It's been hard finding suitable candidates for the job. My main requirement is enthusiasm for learning the trade. 

Because it is a family business we have brought on my sister to help texture and paint drywall. From what I can tell she is not all that interested in learning the job for intrinsic reasons but she is intelligent and a very hard worker. Since my training consisted of me sucking information out of any source I could find, I'm having a hard time figuring out how to train someone who isn't extremely interested. I think it would be easier if we were a drywall crew or something and we could practice mudding together every day but we bounce around between tasks like a bouncy ball thrown down a hallway. We might set cabinets this week, and not do it again for four months. Obviously I am in a pickle as far as creating solid help for our company but I am hoping some amongst you will have some pointers. 

What are some ways you have found to provide good incentives for your employees?

Do you feel like you create motivation amongst your staff or does that come from them?

What is a good way to indoctrinate new employees to bring them onto the same page you are on?

Do you avoid hiring from within the family?

How do YOU lay out clear expectations for your employees?

How do you follow up on these expectations?

Hopefully this rambled-on question makes sense. I look forward to hearing from you all.

Chuck KileAs a new manager, focus on setting clear expectations about the technical work, how to do it, when it needs to be done. Micro-manage. Except for offering a decent wage and respectful treatment, don't spend too much time on motivation, indoctrination, etc. - it is a mistake to think that you know what is going on inside an employee's head or life.

Continually look at individual employees and ask yourself if they are contributing to the future success of your company, not just the current day-to-day operations. If not, figure out if you can change that. If not, let them go.- BobYou MUST have a standard way of doing tasks. You MUST have a standard expected time frame to accomplish said tasks. These are what is known as "systems". Write down how you do everything that you do on a job. This will now become your "training manual" and system. Go from that to teach your new hire's. DO NOT RELY ON WORD OF MOUTH!!! 

Construction can be taught to monkeys if done right. Alot of people will tell you it's rocket science. It's not. There are standard ways of doing things, the good guys follow those standards, and the bad ones don't.

Not pissed. :laughing:

But almost entirely disagree.

Maybe I could teach new hire's how to mow lawns properly, in a somewhat profitable time frame....even with a "system" thrown in there.

Some of us engage in multiple disciplines, covering a vast set of possible scenarios......on daily basis.
Try teaching that to the smartest monkey in the universe.

I find it very challenging to train new hires.
It takes incredible amounts of time, and some real risk.

I had my new(ish) 6 months) guy make one dumb move (after being carefully instructed numerous times) when handling a decent size slab of soapstone, and BOOOOOOM! Pieces on the ground.

I then had another one of my guys (girl actually) fix it like it never happened (snapped at a vein), because she had worked her way up to it through many less complex tasks and proved herself to be worthy of it.

Basically, I think there are a few very important things to remember when training new hires.
1) Plan their ascendancy with exceptional forethought and a deep understanding of skill building.
Work them up through the easier tasks to build skills...and confidence.
2) Make sure your more experienced hands understand the "system" of training. 
I am not the best teacher by temperament. I am decent at what I do, but that isn't enough.
My good friend, and number one Ace, is the professor. He is good cop, I am bad cop. 
I rely on him to sweet talk them and make sure he is taking time to help them understand things as we go along.
3) Be patient.
Every hire is different in some way. My new kid has ADD something fierce, but he is incredibly smart and ultra-motivated. I have had to learn to give him tasks (expectations) in small parcels. Works for us.

You call that defiance?- BobOne of the things I like about Driftweed's post is that it encourages the O.P. to establish systems. Especially when starting out (in business, or managing people, or in a new trade area), that's a good idea.

In a business as diverse as remodeling, that may be difficult. I do know that getting some things written down - job setup and breakdown, cleanup, tool management, some trade practices (painting, drywall, tile, in particular) - has saved me some time and money.

There are lots of ways to skin a cat.

- Bob- BobI really do agree with that. 

I could also probably benefit from a more organized approach (written). 

Not my style though. And I would barely know where to begin ( or end actually). 

It was the monkey thing. 

I can definitely say that training new hires is by far my biggest challenge.

Maybe you missed the thread about gorilla marketing.- BobYou look for attitude, not skill when hiring. Skill can be taught to anyone. Attitude can not. 

Hell, I am a prime example of that.www.callbathdoctor.comIf she is as intelligent and smart as you say she is, she'd be better off trying to help the business in a different way, and not mudding and drywalling. 

If she could work on the business end- dealing with clients, dealing with client expectations, getting deals, making deals, accounting, taking vehicles to get serviced- things that could really help the bottom line.

Instead of you taking a phone call, stopping work, dealing with stuff- you focus on what you do best. Build her into the deal maker. Have her learn how to book and arrange jobs, proper lead times, pre ordering equipment- even pre estimating jobs. 

Realistically, women have a harder time dealing with trades, but since she's your sister, of a father son team, usually that works out fine.Sometimes the easiest thing is to video what you do with what tools and products, then grab stills to show the sequence. Add some captions and you're good to go. 

For technique related things, a video may be a good training aid, but you don't want to be paying someone for sitting around watching a video if you can help it.OP here. Thanks for all of the responses. There are many valid points. 

With the conversation and thought the topic has been refined, at least in my mind. It appears that in the remodeling workplace it is very difficult to train people who have little experience in the hands on work. It is even more difficult to find those with the right attitudes to accomplish it successfully. Don't get me wrong, a lot of sub par crews can get things done but that is not how I like to do things.

I like a well oiled machine oozing in efficiency, and I won't give up until I have it. It has become clear to me that it is very important to have a social structure in a crew. It's like a pack of dogs, a pecking order. Each member must inherently know what is expected of them before they even show up to the job. Habits must be built, like walking onto a job and immediately finding what it is that needs to be done, whether it be from asking others or looking around. It takes a lot of practice and patience from all involved and the rewards must be clear and reachable. An incentive program where you move up when you achieve certain goals and maintain certain expectations likes showing up on time every day. All these things are requirements for a small crew that can take on any task efficiently with quality and speed. 

Please Contractor Talk, tell me about your experiences with different crews, good and bad. Has anyone experienced working with others that worked so well you hardly had to talk? I have a few times and it is a very awesome experience. Very lucrative too.

Cheers

Excellent if you manage their expectations beforehand, and they're not expecting to be supervising on their first day.- BobI think a trade school is a great place to find new guys. I went to one and most of the guys there were looking for skills and would have loved an opportunity to learn on the job. Of course that means some hand holding.
Another place I thought of for an apprentice is an eagle scout troop.I'm working on a remodel where I'm framing in a new interior doorway with decorative or distressed douglas fir post and beam. The posts are going to sit directly on the concrete slab (or close to it) but I'm worried about moisture going into the post. I'd set the posts on a block of PT lumber but I need to keep it close to the slab because the finish floor will not cover the blocking.

Does anyone have any suggestions for protecting the base of the posts on the slabs. Felt? Plastic? A thin slice of PT lumber?

Installing Kerdi membrane in a shower. Using Laticrete 317 thinset and a 1/8 square notch trowel. Mixed the thinset as loose as I could and wet the durock a couple of times with a sponge before troweling on the thinset. Will be setting 8 x 8 travertine.

As you can see from the attached photo, I have a spot where it looks like I might not have gotten good coverage. Is that okay to leave or will I need to cut it out and patch?Cut a slit in the area in question. See if it is secure to the substrate. If it is, patch the slit, if not repair the area. Larger slit, peel back, apply mortar, bed Kerdi, patch slit.

TomHonestly, it's not that bad. I don't see any reason that would fail as is. Is it ideal? No. Will that cause your tile to start falling off the wall? No.AngusPatch for sure.Stevarino said:



Patch for sure.

Click to expand...

:laughing: Really?

So the strength of that entire wall adhered with Kerdi at about 95% is somehow going to fail? I thought gravity pulled down, not outward.

So you're saying that you should cut open a sealed membrane, take the time to remove all the thinset stuck to the Durock (possibly damaging it too) and then put a Kerdi patch back on will be better?

You've now created a section that has 4 more chances to leak. Also, the overall strength of that section is nowhere the strength of the entire Kerdi'd wall, even with the small section that appears to not be totally adhered.

Come on, man. Even the TCNA says 95% coverage on tiles is good enough.

That small section of the Kerdi is not going to cause the installation to fail.Angus95% would be the average.

95% of people graduate kindergarten. You'd have an issue if your child was one of the ones who lowered the average.

The entire wall isnt in question, its that area. If it happens to be the area where a soap dish attaches, yes, it will be substantially weaker. If he's using 12x20 tiles, it probably won't matter as much.

In addition, you chain is only as strong as your weakest link. If the membrane isnt firmly attached, once the tile is attached, will only rip the membrane from the durock side.

I'd say leave it, if it has a good span across some large format tiles. If the tiles end or begin right in that area, its best to cut, check, and patch.You're killing me with the kindergarten comment. :laughing:

Tiling is comprised of individual items creating a system. After all the components are installed, it acts as a system. Tile and gravity don't pull outward. Once the tile of any size is installed and grouted that wall will be fine. The integrity of that one small area isn't going to be affected. The layer of thinset that the tile will be installed with adds another "layer" to the mix technically strengthening it. The thinset acts like a monolithic layer. Just like when the tile is all grouted. That wall is more a single component than it is individual items. 

As I have already said, it's not ideal BUT in my opinion of installing tile for a long time, that Kerdi isn't going anywhere. It's a much lower risk of that Kerdi failing on the Durock than you would get from cutting and patching it. I mean a a sheet of Durock that's only screwed to 95% of the recommended pattern isn't falling off the wall either.AngusI'd be scared to install over this loose Kerdi. I've only had tile come up/loose on one shower and it was a Kerdi floor over a preformed Schluter Styrofoam base. I tiled the walls first and had a large piece of cardboard over the floor but the Kerdi came loose over about an 10" square spot. I thought surely it would be ok being on the floor, but it worked it's way up over about six months and I had to pull up the tile and re-install. 

I've got to where I won't use Schluter products any more. I've had the same situation that you had.... trying to cover a large area with Kerdi before the thinset dries and you end up with Kerdi that you're not sure is properly adhered or not. I don't like the idea of NOT KNOWING. 

Mapei's Aquadefense or RedGard applied to Durock is just so much faster and I'm assured a perfect bond every time. Just install your Durock with little separation, thinset the joints, and roll on three coats of Aquadefense. In a typical shower, I can apply the second coat as soon as I finish the first coat, then apply the third coat in about 30 to 45 minutes. It'll be dry enough to tile in about an hour using a modified thinset.I think one difference is the small floor tile versus the 8 x 8 wall tile I'm doing. The area I was concerned about is the size of maybe 1 tile. Chances are, it will fall under 2 or more tiles when I install the tile. It just seems unlikely that when all the tiles are joined via thinset and grout that anything would ever come loose.daxsmith said:

LOL Well, I've seen a lot of things the pro's show on youtube videos that are flat-out wrong. Like installing a mud shower pan membrane with no blocking between the studs to support the membrane. Or nailing through the membrane when putting backer board on the inside face of the curb with nails maybe at most 1 1/2" to 2 inches above the level of the base. Nails were below the top of the curb.

Lucky for them, I heard that if the OSB didn't pull out, they'd all be much more seriously injured from the blast.My next customer says she has seen were people has put up the 1x4's up on the ceiling instead of toung and groove.

I am dealing with a small kitchen with a 128" wall that will include an oven, dishwasher, and sink. This leaves very little counter top space.

The plan is to install shallow cabinets, (~18" deep) on an adjacent wall to give more counter space. They can only be about 18" because there is an entry door that must clear the cabinets.

The question is, will it look weird if I don't install wall cabs above the shallow cabs? There will be plenty of wall cab space already so I don't see the need for them.

What happened?.... :blink:

.Leaving out the upper cabinets happens all the time. Even when there is room. Open shelves, or hooks for hanging pots are very popular.At 18" deep I think you can still put up upper cabs.

Also, I have had sinks made to fit an 18" cabinet before. Worked out very well.
Cabs n the left are 18" deep, ones on the right are 24" deep.

Or pre-hang the vanity (or use a template), and set up blocking and shims so that the vanity won't bear on any tile, just on the framing. Your blocking and shims will likely be flush with the bottom of the vanity.

Then, tile far enough that the edges of the vanity will cover the tile. Install vanity.- BobFor a tub to shower remodel. It'll be acrylic pan with tile walls.

Its misleading to call Swanstone " solid surface ". There's a glass thru the center of the product. Can sand? Touch it with even 320 and that area's greatly different than the surrounding material. The surface is peaks and valley's so sanding hits the peaks and leaves the valley's producing a mottled look. We fabricated kitchen/bath counters for a few years so I used to work with it a lot.

You can lightly sand because its on a wall. Try laying it down like a counter and check it. The manufacture I linked to gives a lifetime no holes warranty. Swanstone wiggled out of any problems we had. The onyx collection system is so well thought-out that with walls reasonably true you could set the walls and never trim a panel less boring the faucet. I'm glad you like Swan products, are you setting the textured panels?I haven't installed the textured panels as of yet. 
I'm not much of a fan of the Veritek but the swanstone sure thing, except for their vanity tops are kind of strange. 

Yep, quite similar between the onyxcollection and the local manufacturer I use. I do drive slightly further than another place I could get it from because of their warranty. 
Except for the shower bases....swanstone is actually pretty rare here, but the marbles/onyx is used enough to support several somewhat local manufacturers. Lots of showers built with a combination of the two, swan bases with marble/onyx walls.Don Sheppard Construction

Yes my local guy makes shower bases and tubs (even jetted) 
And yes you can help keep the gloss with auto wax/or the actual gel coat product which is really just wax. 

Considering the OP was asking about which swan base to use with tile walls is what started the conversation....I will say that I personally wouldn't consider using a marble/onyx pan with with a tile surround...maybe just my preference.

Kind of an aside, I am wrapping up a master bath shower this week using swanstone base with 2cm quartz panels to the ceiling for the surround. I install any of the other panels myself but the quartz suppliers handle those installs. They did put a scratch in the base but you can't even tell now.Don Sheppard Construction
http://www.facebook.com/FairfieldRemodelingI've only done one with a granite base and tile surround. Just needed to have taller tiles to cover the outer edge of the base. Actually looked pretty good.Looks wise, especially with the granite no doubt it would look good. 

I'd just prefer to use the solid base in case I scratched it up installing tile or grouting :jester: The swan bases come in colors similar to the cast granite. 
And being honest.....I can get the swan bases for a bit less than I can the cast granite bases, about the same as onyx. 
My local guys have pricing tiers lowest to highest being marble, onyx and granite.Don Sheppard Construction
http://www.facebook.com/FairfieldRemodelingI just laid down some deck mud (5:1 sandortland cement) for the preslope on a shower stall. Its probably only been down for 14 hours but it seems like it's hardly set up or dried since then. 

It's relatively cool in here but I'm surprised it's still so damp. I'm sure you guys will say "rip it out and put in Kerdi/wedi , but I've never used those either. This is my first time doing a shower. Hope I don't screw it up!....(as usual, this is my own nightmare of a home)deck mud shower pan

Too much sand. mix it 3 to 1. Too much sand makes it weak. good luck5:1 should have worked, and it would normally be hard after 14 hours, too. Is it actually soft, or is it hard but still cool and damp to the touch? What was the consistency when you mixed it and packed it? Brown sugar? Pourable?- Bob5:1 should still set up just fine... Bagged Sakrete is about 3:1, and I always cut it down with a few shovels of plain sand... No issues so far. 

Did you use too much water? It doesnt take much to hydrate the cement. Did you pack it down tight? Hit it with a steel trowel to finish?

Mud usually still looks wet the next day, but should be firm. The cold temps would extend the cure time.


I'm a Kerdi guy, but almost never use the foam trays. I like playing in the mud.- Alex :thumbsup:

Yea I like a 3 to 1 mix personally but meant to mention maybe too much water. No coffee yet. I did an addition last year and my mason had to do brick twice. Could rub the mix off with your finger. He blamed it on a new helper of his. Too much sand. Glad I checked as it could have been ugly.roofing felt under your mix
set your lath/mesh
set bottom of clamp drain
4 parts sand to 1 part Portland cement, you can mix with latex additive

I wait 24 hours

Now you can start setting your pan:
Pan liner 6" past top of curb
cut hole for & install drain
make sure not to block weep holes (cover holes with stone or spacers)
set your wallboard
4 parts sand to 1 part Portland cement mix with water 
slope properly

curbAngusIt takes days for it actually be done curing...
As long as its firm you should be good.I mixed just enough water so I could stick it together and I did beat it down packed with my trowel. I used 15 felt to keep it from contacting my subfloor and 1/4" wire mesh. I'm hoping it just needs some more time, but I may have been too sandy.dielectricunion said:

Did it pack down nice?The Following User Says Thank You to Inner10 For This Useful Post: Leo GYeah, it packed in nice and smooth. I'm concerned that my measuring technique was way off. I dumped 2.5 bags of (50 lb) sand into a wheelbarrow and then 3 scoops of portland (in a cut down plastic jug that I determined to be 1/6 of a bag of sand).

I just measured out a bag of sand using my scoop and my eyeballs are off. Each scoop is really about 1/8 of a sand bag. This means I should have added 4 scoops to be 5:1.

On the other hand, maybe 5:1 should be by weight and sand is heavier, therefore I really failed?dielectricunion said:

Agreed. My gut reaction was the same. The architect didn't place those windows in a way that would be the least bit appealing to the eye. It's just a weird looking house at first glance.

Sorry Rob that I could not be of more help, but I doubt that anything superficial could help that look. Perhaps some shutters, and some type of fake window look with shutters to balance out the awkwardly large gap between the second floor windows.

Looks like a nice house otherwise already...just an ugly front elevation.220...221...whatever it takes!Replace the columns. get rid of the landscaping in front of the porch, install an octagon window between 2nd floor windows and to the right of the door left of the other windows or build a gable front porch.

Do something with whatever that is hanging to the right of the door on the siding!At the bare minimum rip out landscape in front of the front porch and add something low growing, add some posts/handrail and shutters, I like the octagon window idea upstairs too. Also make the handrail flow and match the deck handrail over the garage by either building one like it or replace that too, Symmetry. Also the front windows next to the entrance look like a garage door (wanna hit the opener and drive into the living room) lolYou're going to have to make the fascia line up on both roofs to make that look anywhere near aesthetically pleasing.

Seems pretty likely there's an interior partition wall where a third window would go. Maybe put a gable over the porch?

I was thinking along the same lines, possibly a stair well or 2nd floor closets.Just designed this a few months ago for a customer. It's a similar house, they just added second floor above the garage.
You will get the idea,I hope it helps.

Good luck, I hope you get the job!I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​Just when I had an awesome list of subs in Alaska I moved twice, and now I'm in Portland, OR area for the long haul getting everything started back up again.

I'm having a hard time finding a quality, professional, reliable and reasonable plumbing sub. I'd like to think I'm about as good to work with as they come. I have everything ready and cleaned out the day I say I will. I personally write the checks, and I'll do it the moment the job is done. No delays, no check is in the mail, no homeowner hasn't paid me yet.

I have a steady stream of work and I can complete about 3 jobs a month that require permitted plumbing work. Low volume but steady.

The negative is job size. Maybe half of my jobs are little 5x7 bath redos where I just need a tub and valve installed, and later trim. Two 2 hour visits. The rest are more involved with re-pipes, additions, sub-slab, often 8-16 man-hours for rough in.

I've contacted about 15 plumbers and had mostly negative or non-existent response. Google, craigslist, and recommendations from supply houses.

The few responses I've had are giving me flat rate numbers that are well over the ~$200 an hour I'd be willing to pay for a plumber and apprentice. I'm looking for good to work with, reliable, etc, not the cheapest.

I guess this is kind of just a rant, but any suggestions on where to look and maybe what plumbers want to here from me?You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.IMO, two things going against you....

You are the FNG in town with no reputation.

Second is residential remodeling...normally a HUGE PITA for subs.

Just keep asking.

Two good bets:

an older semi retired guy....or

a new guy trying to get established.....

It's almost to the point where I could employ a plumber full time for less money.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.I have to agree with Griz.....if someone calls me out of the blue to sub.....it raises concern if I bite.......I don't know you so I have to keep short accounts.....and sorry if my trucks rollin.....I'm makin moneyI'm all for freedom of speech but Irish is costing lives on this threadLook for a service plumber. Thats what our plumber does primarily. He used to do a lot of big multi family stuff, now he wants to do smaller stuff and service work. Doing our work gets him in with our homeowners, who are not the type to work on their homes. We give our clients the names and contact info of all the MEP subs when we complete their projects. 

As far as remodel subs go, it would be tough for a lot of trades, like drywall to get on something like a bathroom. We do a lot of additions and whole house remodels, so the subs bear with us on the smaller jobs. But we have an in house painter/drywall guy for just that purpose, and cabinet finishes. That way I dont have to call a sub to drywall or paint a bathroom.

When we first started we started strong, built a few houses and some additions, then had an 18 month period where we didnt have a good sized job due to the recession, other than one house and a cottage. I got pretty good at doing everything I could legally do at that time. 

Like Griz said, your new in town. Your a good contractor, it wont take long to get a reputation among the subs as a good guy to work for.Everybody wants to be a beast until it's time to do what beasts do - Eric ThomasThe new guy is a way to go for subs on remodels if you are in tuned with the local trades reps. When my roofer died, we did a lot of our own roofing for a while while trying to vet a new one. We generally only do R panel and U panel in house, I sub dimensional, standing seam and tile ( except for tile repairs sometimes) generally. The guy we ended up going with was an installer who was subbing from roofers with his crew. He was trying hard to break out as a roofing contractor. He is everything you look for in a sub, prompt, well healed and does clean, professional installs. I refer straight roofing jobs I dont want to him all the time, and sub quite a few to him every year.

Same thing for my painter/drywall guy. 

Both subs have been with me for 3 years, both businesses have expanded because of their hard work and determination. Meanwhile they still like doing my work because I am not a cheap skate and we pay promptly.Everybody wants to be a beast until it's time to do what beasts do - Eric ThomasI may have found my guy. I'm trying him out on a small job and then I have a good sized one to jump start our working relationship.

I think I pretty well understand all the concerns subs have when hearing from me and I think after a couple jobs they will be happy. I will even schedule the entire project around their down days so they keep busy and making money. I'm pretty skilled in all the trades and ill happily do anything I need to to keep projects on track. 

It's been humbling. Things were going so well before, I was turning down 80% of new work, and I pretty much always had a sub eager to do the work for me. Now I'm back to the start, I'll be filling in doing anything I legally can.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.I'm sure some of my issues could just be not understanding this market, which might bear the numbers that seem crazy to me.

For example, a common small job for me, I don't make much money but it's easy to schedule and i could live off of only these if needed, is a small simple bath update.
Day 1: set up, demo and clean
Day 2: install new tub and valve in the morning, cbu and waterproof surround
Day 3: install the majority of the tile, all if possible
Day 4: wall sand, repair, skim. Grout
Day 5: sand walls, touch up, prime, paint. Install vanity and toilet, plumbing trim
Day 6: usually something pushes the end day here

Before, a simplified breakdown of my numbers, normalized to $100 hide the true numbers:
$50 materials
$30 self performed work, overhead and profit
$20 plumbing and electric sub 
$100 cost to customer

Now it's more like 
$50 materials
$30 self performed work, oh and profit. 
$40 plumbing and electric sub

That could be many things, like getting higher prices than your used to because your starting out again doing smaller jobs, smaller jobs mean more PITA money to some subs.

Might be the new locale has higher rates than your used to.

Might be the economy is up there and the subs raised their rates. 

I pay attention to what stuff is going for, but I dont get hung up "too" much on the subs prices as long as they seem reasonable. My drywall sub has gone up considerably over the last year per sq ft. He is charging quite a bit more for remodel drywall vs new stuff like my additions or a whole house gut. I dont blame him, he is making it while it is there. Also, on a remodel, I figure re texturing the whole affected area now, so it often ends up being more per sq ft than new construction drywall.

There are a couple excellent subs that id like to switch to because they are that step above good, but cant really afford them right now without lowering my mark up, and my current subs are good, just require some watching as far as the little things. 

Another good thing for service MEP guys is they are a bit more reactive when you are in a jamb, like finding a surprise behind a wall. They are used to emergency service calls. I like to be proactive with my schedules, but sometimes stuff happens.Everybody wants to be a beast until it's time to do what beasts do - Eric ThomasGolden view said:

That is a very aggressive schedule if you can make it work:thumbsup: No inspections? How are you doing new tub, toilet and vanity without new flooring?

I agree with Jaws that you should find a service plumber.I pretty much only do small remodels and I have found that service MEP's are the way to go. They can actually fit me into their schedules and they have enough flexibility that I can do a demo on Monday and they'll still be able to fix the surprises on Tuesday. Passing their name on to customers and other contacts keeps them pretty loyal. Along with paying the bill on time. I usually have to pin my plumber down and make him tell me an amount on inspection day so I can cut him a check.

Two things about the service guys that I run into: 1. I call them regularly to remind them of upcoming projects, even the day before. Their schedules can get crazy so it's better to remain in their mind than get stood up and complain about it. 2. They usually have higher hourly rates. It's worth it to me.Jaws;1780140 said:

Click to expand...After a huge amount of searching I think I found my guy. All the right attributes and cheaper than I expected. He isn't actually a service plumber. He does new construction for a contractor or two that keeps him busy half the time and fills in the rest with remodels.

He did a bathroom for me today and was great. Probably the smoothest bathroom I've ever done. Demoed and roughed in all before 3pm. Also met with me for more than an hour for a much more involved job.

Thanks for the CT support.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.If anyone cares, an update: Things are going well. My plumber is fantastic, the best I've ever worked with. I found a good electrician, and HVAC guy. Any by odd coincidence, my glass installer is an old acquaintance and good friend of friends from Alaska.

Also, he doesn't know it yet, but I'm going to start using CT member Metro M&L for flooring if possible!You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.Andrew, I've read your experience with interest. With my wife about to finish law school and Rhode Island being a small state, I feel I could easily end up starting fresh in another New England state or farther away. 

My hypothetical anxiety is due to the idea of starting over with new subs & suppliers. I can sell and am confident in my abilities to locate/close work but I, like you, would be another strongly rooted, local contractor forced to start fresh. Glad to see as of your last post, that all is well with your new subs. 

Have you had good luck with your new Portland suppliers? I have 2 great local supplier salesmen that both have sent multiple jobs my way(other contractors and homeowners). If treated well, loyal and maintain a trust that you'll do right by their recommendation, these guys can be one of the most valuable assets around.

Ethan, I've only ever worked in RI, and eastern Mass. Being a local, born and raised here has it's advantages and a certain level of comfort. I've also benefited from being a 3rd gen contractor when it comes to acquiring subs. Many of the same guys who had an excellent relationship with my dad, now work with me. It's almost like a level of family loyalty is expected on both sides, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

It can get fairly ridiculous with some of the stupid stuff, but above somebody mentioned keeping all fixtures off the floor. I've done that once with one bathroom and it was sweet. There's also a toilet that cleans itself.

and while you're at it introduce the client to Bisazza tile and make a real statement with a beautifully designed mosaic wall.

That's pretty much the first thing I tell em, is that the tub will come out in pieces, and you're welcome to take it to the scrap dealer and get about $50, otherwise I'm giving it to a local guy that wants it.KermieB said:

I like the blanket idea. I had a friend show me the proper way to break one up. Knowing the vulnerable areas of the tub is key. He stood inside the tub and directed short swings at key points. I think between the overflow and the drain was the first break. Then he moved to the sides towards the drain. In less than 5 minutes, it was in about 12 manageable pieces.MarkJames said:

We start on the middle of the outside near the bottom and work our way up. Knock out the top then work your way down the inside. Once you are at the base move to the wall side just below the 2x4 ledger and each down that side across the base to the other break.Tried & True on Facebook

Facebook​Small bathrooms take aslong as big bathrooms not time wise just days, you work yourself out of work too fast!!! Mud, waiting to dry paint waiting to dry!!!

Atleast I got my tub free and had the Ho drag it out do I could take it too the scrap yard , just enough to pay my gas!!!!I have a client that is selling their house (actually already sold) and someone they called to repair tub is unable to make it out before the clients are moving out on April 6th. The repair was indicated on the buyer's home inspection and my client asked me if I can fix it. I told them I've never done this, but would check into it. If I don't feel comfortable, I told them I wouldn't do it.

It has been repaired before. There is a 3"x4" spot on the soap dish wall of the tub itself where it is discolored, and it has a small crack about an inch long. I will post a picture if necessary, but my connection here is slower than dial up, so its a royal pain to do.

Anyone familiar with this and have some suggestions. I see some products offered at the Slowes and Home Freako, and on the internet, but, as I said, I have zero familiarity.Not a pretty repair, but JB weld epoxy will make a watertight repair.
Total replacement or professional repair and refinish is the other option.

I have a guy that does tub and shower refinishing, but I usually I don't recommend to customers to have it refinished if they are not selling the house. It only lasts so long.
If you are going to repair a crack in a fiberglass tub, it should really be reinforced from under with fiberglass and resin, but most times there's no access to the backside. 
The stuff they professionally spray is stinky and requires lots of ventilation and respirators. Not a DIY job.tipitop;2814937 said:

And it is precisely such a thing I would not be comfortable doing unless someone with the skill and know how was there holding my hand and walking me through it. Even then, still questionable. I am pretty skilled at painting an automotive finish, and fiberglass repairs on autos, but something of this nature is not exactly what I was hopeful of.

I sure appreciate your input, Kevin! Huge Help!:thumbsup:The new homeowners should be able to wait for the professional to come repair it. As long as there is confirmation the repair will be done, it shouldn't hold stuff up.

I've watched them do a few repairs. Doesn't look too hard. I think I would want to practice first. I know I wouldn't jump into it on a customer's job. I would be setting myself up for failure.Thanks everybody for your input! :thumbsup:

I have decided against trying to repair the tub. It just makes the best sense not to.Not literally, as my roofing hatchet still comes in handy for chopping stuff, but I did switch jobs.

I'm happy to be working for one of the best remodel companies in our city now, Bly Bennett inc. We mostly do historic renovations on the north side of Indianapolis. 

I know this probably belongs in the intro section, but at least I have some photos to post! These are two jobs out of 7-8 we have going on now. Love these old houses!i`m going to frame up a partition on a finish marble floor.
but they don`t want me to screw the wall down.
I`m trying to find out if I caulk it with layex ,, or silicone caulk , , or maybe use heavy duty Velcro tape, or double stich-tape ,if , over time , will it bleed into the tiles and stain them.
its in a high end ,14,000 sq. ft water front home.
its actually being rented out to a consulate.

the owner/landlord is pretty concerned about this.

apparently its a pretty expensive marble , its in 24 inch squares , and is pure white.its got a high polish finish on it .
they want to close the kitchen off from the living room.
its aprox , 16 ft, x 10 ft. high,
iy will be screwed into an existing wall , and the ceiling.
it`ll also return and go 8 ft, into another wall.

any input?If it's polished and not porous, 100% silicone caulk would work.tipitop;2814937 said:

Click to expand...Some sort of rubber, either feet or sheet is what i would try to come up with. I'd be concerned whatever method is used that it will stain.I'd use phenoseal or polyseamseal (tub and bath).

Both have tenacious bite and can be carefully removed with wet scraping.

If it were ever removed, i'd think any issues could easily be buffed away."Under promise, over deliver and all that!" JBM

https://www.facebook.com/Superseal-Construction-162699413750013/Marble is soft as butter. I would be concerned with cracking the tile with the concentrated weight of the wall.Patriotism is being loyal to your country all the time and your government when it deserves it. Mark TwainCan you use some 10d finish nails and hit a grout line?Not all silicones are neutral cure. Some use an acid formula which will eat into the marble. Latisil from Laticrete is neutral cure.

I think I would silicone the wall plate onto small squares of Corian or similar product that was finished nailed in the grout joint.Does it matter? The wall weight will crack the stuff in time, then replace it all then!

AND why or what are they doing this for??? Save the MARBLE??

If you read what the OP stated it's a very high end property being rented out to possibly a person from a foreign country. They may not like the open concept and want the kitchen separated. The owner wants to be able to remove the wall with no damage to what might be very expensive marble.

If it's a 14,000 sq. ft. home you could imagine that could be a lot of tile to replace. I also wouldn't assume that the weight of the wall would crack the tile, the only way I see that happening would be from too much pressure from possible movement.Maybe use light gauge steel studs and ultralight sheetrock to lessen weight of wall?tipitop;2814937 said:

Click to expand...I'm not picturing the layout well. Any way to run a header just off the floor to act as bottom plate keep the bottom straight & fairly rigid & point load the walls own weight on to existing?

Sounds like maybe it's 2 new walls with a corner. IF the bottom "plates" are made stiff enough, and the tie ins to the existing and the corner itself are locked in solid, it seems like it would be fine with no floor anchors in new walls. Think of it like a triangle where the leg between the ties into existing is implied but not actually present. (That leg doesn't actually have to be there, the exist points just cant move in order to keep the new point (new corner) in position.)  The 2 new legs of the triangle need to be continuous and rigid (maybe real heavy gauge track w/additional reinforcement, box header, or horizontal LVL as bottom plates). Might feel a bit springy if actually pushed, but should stay in place. No door openings allowed with this idea of course. 

Weight bearing issue is different consideration. Could be hung perhaps. I think the marble would probably bear the actual weight of just the wall itself as long as the thinset bed is well done underneath. Seems live load deflection of floor and ceiling would be the forces that could cause it to crack.

Could point hang a post at the new corner to just off existing floor. You could go so far as to make mini lvl strongback "bottom plates" to deal with both lateral rigidity of bottom plates, and weight bearing issues. At a glance it seems excessive, but could be workable. 

There is obviously huge money in the owners pockets. If they want a good solution to an odd problem in a very high end setting, don't skimp on the solution or your compensation for it. It's not your problem if it is ridiculously expensive to run 24' of wall while meeting their desired parameters.

I actually like JAH's idea of a couple minimal floor pins into grout lines. Extremely minimal visual impact if well patched (if ever). But maybe that's just thinking too normal, with normal reasonable budget mentality.For some reason I just pictured the owner standing in this giant gazillion dollar oceanfront mansion, in his 950k kitchen, fiddling with his cabinet door opener remote control, saying- "What! You want almost $1600 just to do that! Pepe, the pool boy's assistant's assistant, said he could easily do it for less than $700. I can't afford to be scammed like that by people like you!"Analysis Paralysis....

I like this idea. Just make it like a suspended deck beam a few inches off the floor. Lam beam it at the bottom and hang the short wall off of it. Then build your wall on top of that. Trim it so it just sits off the floor and be done with it. Easy Peasy.

I would assume your budget is pretty much non existent up to a point. They are mostly concerned with not redoing a very expensive floor. If your solution solves that problem, you have done your job and they will be happy.Dave in Pa said:

 it doesn`t matter if it seems ridiculous or not. if you sign up for a job , you do it the best you can.

its a pretty unique floor.and it goes through all rooms , on both floors.
it`d be a shame if they had to try to replace it and couldn't`
the house is from the 40`s , and has been totally re-done and I is in pristine condition. its easily in the $15 million range.
I did use the pure silicone/ it went fine .
truly , no one won`t know if it stains or not , until it is removed 
the consulate who is renting it , most likely will stay there over 10m years.
as for the weight, it isn`t that bad.
I used mostly metal studs.
I adheised a wood 2x4 to the floor, then put a metal track on that.
I did the same on the ceiling.
then I put wood studs every 4 feet, and made the rest with metal studs to keep weight down.

they`re great clients.
I`ve been maintaining the previous house they rented , for the last 7 years.

they have a live in chef. he is almost as important as the general residing there.
they sometimes entertain as many as 300 political big wigs.
the chef wants the kitchen closed off . I have to sound-proof the wall too.So here is an interesting one of the crew are currently working on this week. History behind the project. 1950's house, masonry construction, original house has single entry door. H.O. who is a real estate agent does renovations last year

Change entry door from single to double, remove bearing wall and add beam to replace, along with lots of other cosmetic items.

We get referred to him as it appears his new beam is sagging. Pickle and I go and snap a line on this beam, 18' span, 1" bow in the centre of the beam. Strip the drywall, it's a 3 ply 9 1/2" LVL spanning 18', one side is supported with 2 - 2x, other end is sitting on a 3x3x3/16" angle front above the front door :laughing:

This beam is holding up the 2nd floor and roof :blink:

Needless to say, I tell him to get an engineer, steel beams are in order (we can go thinner thus allowing full casing around the door, not some ripped trim cause the beam is too big)

So I have one guy who is multi talented, surgeon like, supports the 2nd floor to the main with alumibeams and shoring jacks, and does the same below from main floor to basement floor. Bottle jack and spends about an hour lifting the 2nd floor and roof back up, miraculously the 2nd floor meets the 1/4 round again, the shower floor in the ensuite meets the tile walls again, the bedroom doors don't close by themselves anymore.

Remove the masonry above the front door, install steel beam above door with flanges to accept beam holding up 2nd floor (T pattern), 10 guys at 7:30am lifting an 18' steel beam into place in the middle of the house...priceless

Where am I going with all this? I gave the guy the price and it literally knocked him on the ground originally, he has a bad taste with contractors since the first one did some really shabby workmanship (remind me to tell you about the dryer type flex duct running from the basement to the 2nd floor). Needless to say, after he witnesses the job being done correctly, he admits he sees why I charge what I charge.

The bonus part...he is a real estate agent and has already put us onto 2 confirmed projects and awaiting plans to bid another

Normally I would walk away from jobs like this, the hassle since another contractor did them wrong, the bad taste they have, I usually don't have the patience to deal with these people who now think everyone is out to steal from them. Kind of glad I stuck this one out.ChrisSo....how much did ya charge?The Following User Says Thank You to Inner10 For This Useful Post: Leo Gso how much is it sagging now or did it fall down :whistlingNice job Chris :thumbsup: What size steel beam did you end up going with for an 18' span?I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​[email protected] beam above the door and same to hold the floor. 2-6x6 angle iron with A325 bolts where they T together and above the door is shimmed and welded on top of masonry wall with the original 3x3 angle iron still in place. Did not want to remove for concern of damaging exterior brick and not being able to match mortar.

What did I charge...a hell of lot more then the guy was expecting, but after seeing what it took to do it right he admitted he understood the reason for the price he is payingChrisSo 350 ish...The Following User Says Thank You to Inner10 For This Useful Post: Leo GGood job! 

Second floor and the roof load? 

A mighty fine thing you are located near the tropics where you don't get any snow loads on the roof!:no:

I like those aluminum beams. Did you just so happen to have those laying around in just the right lengths?Most of the time the hardest part of the job is convincing the owner your not a crook with your price. Glad to hear you accomplished that and gained some respect in the process!Had inspection a couple of hours ago, inspector commented to my guy how complicated the project was, and home owner was there while it was said.

He even passed it as a final inspection because if we can do what we did so far, some minor framing and drywall won't be a problemChrisI love when inspector says that.

It's not the 10 guys there for 30 minutes, it's the hour drive they all had to the project they are on. I just brought them in first thing to lift then sent them to their respective projects which during Toronto rush hour is an hour or so no matter how you cut it.ChrisJeff G said:

It's alumibeam, I own 700' plus another 90 shoring jacks. We use it for insuldeck and suspended slabs...and holding up houses while we replace beams apparently.

If we run short I can rent or buy more, I buy used, it's not much difference between the two other then used is about 40% of new price. Once you own the stuff you'll be amazed at the jobs you find other uses for. I.E. You will never build a temp 2x4 support wall for anything, stick it in, take it out, easy to storeChrisThanks, Chris!

When I first saw your original post, I did a google search for alumibeam but got 47 gazillion hits and, from all that I looked at, it wasn't exactly what I see in your pic. sure looks like something I would love to have.

I will try the search again. Maybe I typed something wrong.Inner10 said:

Ya I think so too. I've been paying that price for the past 3 years, no increase or decrease and that's delivered too.

The steel company I deal with is almost an hour outside of the city, I am their only Toronto customer and they deliver 1 piece of steel or a truck load, it's all no charge delivery...but I buy a lot of steel.

I know I should buy locally and support the local economy, however the price difference between the locals and my supplier is too great to ignore. Originally when I called them 3 years ago the girl said no Toronto deliveries, I begged and pleaded with her, she finally agreed if I took delivery between 10 and noon so traffic wasn't going to kill them...I gave her an initial order for 40 tons of rebar and they have been happy ever since and deliver whenever and wherever I want.

We don't abuse them, I still ask for their preferable time to deliver and work with that.ChrisAlumibeam may not be the correct terminology, it's what we call it here.

Renovator's Supply has been my goto for ages.

Got real sassy with my place and put solid pine doors with standard backset, glass fluted privacy sets everywhere.

But here's the trouble: The knobs are not retained via the method of placing in a retaining cup, and then the flange bent over.

Instead, they are glued(epoxied/crazy glue?).

And eventually the glue fails.

Usually when you are in the crapper, and its the inside knob, and you can't get out.

I ordered these and they seem to be a quality set. Better than your standard schlage.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.i've never made a wall w/4 or 6 mil vapor barrier on the inside(between stud and drywall) and living in the pacific northwest it was my understanding that it made the drywall mold... but i was watching this Canadian show holms on homes and he keeps saying that its crazy no one does this?? anyone got comments?tttIt is one way to meet the code in the NW.

From the code:
The building design shall not create conditions of accelerated deterioration from moisture condensation. Above-grade frame walls, floors and ceilings not ventilated to allow moisture to escape shall be provided with an approved vapor retarder. The vapor retarder shall be installed on the warm-in-winter side of the thermal insulation.

These are 3 of the most common ways to meet the code:

1. unfaced batt insulation with 4 mil poly

2. faced batts

3. unfaced batts with a PVA primer on the drywall


Which one do you think works the best?well i guess ive always used faced bats, never had any call backs or mildew. the 4 mil seems more effective, but like i said when ive demo walls w/ it there was always mildew on the rock? maybe the moisture was from somewhere else. still ill have to think on it!Sometimes in SC

Just replaced a shower valve in a bathroom where the plumbing was leaking. When I removed the granite wall sections. There was 4 mil plastic as a barrier. Luckily for the homeowner, the plastic also acted as a water barrier and were did not have to replace the studs nor the bottom plate, which was listed in my estimate. The plastic did not keep out every bit of water, but it did help prolong the life of the walls interior components. 
Couln't hurt.Knowledge is Power. Learning more about what I do, Is all in a days work!from the manufacturer of durock, vapor barrier must be installed agianst studs

green drywall no vapor barrier against studs

we use drywall and kerdi so no need for vb. 

redgard on face of durock, no vb.we build almost all of our homes that way in Minnesota. R-19 batts between the studs, 4 or 6 mil vapor barrier sealed at the plates and to the ceiling poly and at the electrical boxes, then drywall. it is basically the code here. you could eliminate the poly and use a 0 perm primer on the drywall after finishing, but in general the vapor barrier is on the inside.Here in Ontario, its code that we use 6 mil vapour barrier. It must be continuous through all plates and walls where they meet the cold. New this year is they make us put air barrier through our top plates and tie it to the vapour barrier at the roof. We also put it under the mud sills and tie it to the vapour barrier in the basement. I have worked on lots of old houses that had no vapour barrier, and mold was a problem without it. One house I rented when I was young was so bad, that if you piled anything against the walls, you would have mold growing within weeks. Maybe it is the cold in the winter up here that creates the moisture.What do the ontario guys do round the stacks and behind bulk heads where there are pipes and wires etc close to the wall,its almost impossible to get a good sealbbgcarpentry said:

I've seen a number of shows with him marching around while the vapour barrier is going up, going on and on about how every single pin hole must be taped up, and every staple snug against the studs, only to see him five minutes later driving a four inch anchor through the drywall with VB behind it to hold up one end of a kitchen cabinet upper that wouldn't catch a stud. Safe to say that left a puncture.

My opinion on the question you've asked is that Canadians want to live in sealed tupperware boxes.

In contrast to muskoka, I've also renoed/worked on houses here before the days of VB and have yet to find one with mold/mildew/rot/fungus etc. that could be put down to a lack of a vapour barrier.Knight-Builder said:

Our local building inspector has similar minded qualms, but as he says, code is code.I've had the pleasure of adding on to a home I built in Fairbanks Alaska (-50 degree winters), so I could open up walls and see that there were no moisture issues in a wall assembly I always worried would hold moisture.

Yeah a sil plate made out of a piece of timber kinda like a rail road tie.The Following User Says Thank You to Inner10 For This Useful Post: Leo GWe're looking at a siding job on a 1979 prefab. Ya, I know... Anyway, it looks like it has 1" foil faced foam on exterior of framing. I'm not sure if this is also the sheathing, or not. Does any one put house wrap over this? R-Board? Nothing? What possible breathing/drying issues might occur with vinyl siding over the top? Thanks for any input.I'm not a fan of foil faced insulation on the exterior in cold climates because of it's low permeability, and usually (but not always) it's polyisocyanurate which degrades in performance as it gets colder. If there's poly as the vapour barrier inside, which is usually done in cold climates like yours, then there could be problems because the wall has nowhere to dry. 1" of foam (if that's what it is) on the exterior is a little risky too check out your building code for minimum exterior R-value for the wall depth. 

If it's really well air sealed though and the house hasn't had any moisture problems, then putting house wrap on the outside isn't going to cause any problems. 
There was a similar discussion here where a house wrap vendor weighed in on the discussion: http://www.contractortalk.com/f33/house-wrap-question-165050/Thanks for the reply. That was a good thread, sorry that I missed it earlier. I will for sure check with the B.O. for his official opinion. Now I wonder if we should look at removing the foam? The cost always plays into these decisions too. I still need to see if there is wood sheathing under the foam, or not. There were some foolish things done to save a buck back in the day.Very doubtful that the "foam" would have been considered in the lateral loading calculations. At least I have never seen that. Probably likely that there is sheeting or let-in bracing on the wall.
Now whether or not foil faced insulation is used the foil should not be touching anything else like sheeting or siding or any other material as this will basically render the foil useless. It needs an air gap between the foil facing and any other material of about 1-1/2", which is I believe the average distance most use.

It could be the foil has holes in it for permeability but I am not convinced the holes are of much value for that. I like the idea of a continuous insulation like this though so I would recommend replacing the foil foam with non-faced foam then the WRB like Tyvek.

Andy.https://andytardif.wixsite.com/websiteI have not used the ThermalWrap product, but I see nothing in their data reports that indicates that it has been tested to any of the recognized thermal resistance standards, only sheathing membrane and air barrier. I would put the thermal claims in the realm of marketing hype like bubble wrap. 
Sounds like they're going for a radiative r-value much like the foil faced, which I have little faith in. As Andy mentioned, a radiative insulation gain needs an air space, an enclosed undisturbed air space at that or wind washing and convective currents can negate its benefits. And if it gets covered in dust or dirt the radiative insulating value is negated further. 
A bit heavy in nerd speak, but this research paper describes some of the effects. 
http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.nibs.org/resource/resmgr/BEST/best3_saber.2.14.pdfI was skeptical of the R-value as well. The install process also seemed to be heavy on details, and short on production. I know that details are very important, however, it seems to set you up to fail rather than realize any actual gains. Andy, sorry about the link. Don't know what happened. I'm trying to learn though, do I get points for that?I'm about to start work on a front porch for this couple who's wanting to make the front of their house look less boxy. I've been sketching up some ideas for what I'm thinking they want because they said they were wanting something like a gable to match the gables on the second floor. They're wanting to extend it all the way out to the end of the house. Can you give me some critiques on my sketches and make some suggestions on how you'd handle this project? The placement of the door is what's making it difficult for me to handle because it's just in such an odd spot.This is what the front of the house looks like for reference.How about something like this, also might want add a window or something in the 2nd floor dead spaceHave you qualified them for budget yet? That's the sort of project that can waste a lot of time, until they find out it isn't $200, and say, oh, never mind.- BobSorry, kind of boring.

Dude! That's just the software I need. Where did you get it? I've already got their budget and they've already paid to secure my services. I just have to get a sketch right that can work with the budget. I know they want it to extend to the end, but I'm trying to work within constraints I have. They sent me this picture of a house they found with a style they were wanting, but I just don't know if it's going to be something that can be done. I just can't get past the boxiness of this house.It is Chief Architect Premier version X-7.

Andy.https://andytardif.wixsite.com/websiteI downloaded that software last night after emailing you. Sadly my video card doesn't support it. I've been reading all morning how to work that software. It's a bit complex for someone who has basic computer skills really.Take Andy's drawing in post #5 and extend the shed roof to the right (entire length of front of house or set back from the corner of the house 1 -2 ft). The front door location is what it is, unless the homeowners want to pay to change it.

You could remove the existing front door, install a new one, centered in the opening. Could add side lights for more detail.Look into Google Sketchup (http://www.sketchup.com/). Number of people us it for design software. Is a free download and lots of tutorials on Youtube.

Or hire Andy. I think he has done design work for people on here before. Im speaking way out of turn here so may be way off!!!What kind of floor do they want to have? If slab, then you will need a perimeter frost footing all the way around under the outside edge of the slab. If wood or composite floor then you will have piers, beams, joists and a ledger. Either way I think the brick under the window will need to go and if that goes then the brick front of the garage should get removed as well IMO.

As a couple others have said if you can put in a new front door with sidelights it would help with the look. Is the round window on a stair landing or can you expand the opening in that direction.

Here are some photos of a job we did the carpentry on this summer that is similar to yours. They wanted to get rid of the dated brick on the front, remove some posts and dress up the roof over the front door.I have a customer that I am installing eainscotting for in a dining room.

Like Tom said use a rabbeting bit. Before you install the panels clip the corners a 45* at the chop saw so you don't have to square the corners with a chisel. If you cut off just enough it still covers. Apply glue to the rabbets, set the panels, and shoot in with an upholstery stapler with 1/2" staples. You use an upholstery stapler because the staples are designed not to over drive and daylight out on the finished face.

On angled panels like the one pictured before I use a trim router with a 1/4" bit in addition to the rabbeting bit on the acute angled corners. The rabbeting bit can't get into the corner tight enough remove all the necessary material in these corners. Set the trim router to the same depth as the rabbet and free hand out enough material to allow the long point of the panel to recess in without having to be clipped.My customer purchased themselves a set of Dreamline Charisma sliding doors for a tub. What a pita that thing was! It has only a top and bottom rail, no frame. No adjustability, no side frame on this thing so you need plumb walls and an absolutely level top rail from the get go...A bit harder to get top rail plumb to the bottom rail, it turned out.

Well, I took the plunge only to find the outer edge of my tub top was both angled inward and slightly curved like a surfboard from end to end. (I would have sworn that thing was level at first sight.) Made for a fun, long install. I set the bottom rail in silicone and decided not to drill the nice cast iron tub like the instructions indicated. Next day (when silicone dry), hung the doors (another pita) only to find that while my bottom rail was level, it was slightly angled inward and it made a huge difference for the door guides. 

When I was finished, I told them I just added it to my bucket list. Translation: Installing that model is now checked off for life. Took me over 4 hrs for this blasted thing. 

This is the one:
http://www.faucetdirect.com/dreamli...a-tub-door-bypass-sliding-56-60-x-58/p1912761That looks like a disaster waiting to happen. Only having the clips holding the top rail is a bit scary.

I double my install cost when I have to install a customer provided door.

My latest one is going to require me to reinstall the surround as the plumbers just screwed it to the unplumb walls. 

I even plumbed the surround once, then after trimming it, due to reveals, it went back out of plumb.

The cuts surely took an hour.

The constant measuring and cutting really kill production. Also was a challenge not having room to work and stage materials.

I do this. If I have to put in replacement windows, I drill holes in the old sashes and spray foam into them. A lot of the air-infiltration comes from around the old window.

I've heard good things about those. Thinking of pulling the trigger soon. My remodels are always a mess.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.Build clean is just a 600 cfm Hepa scrubber. the priceis about the same as the Dri eze or the Ermator A600.

I have used a Drieaz since 2008. they work well, you need to use them in conjunction with:
Barriers to maximise air exchange from the work area to the clean area (making the most of the negative pressure differential, you do not seal the area like they teach you in the RRP class rather you have make up air openings at the ceiling area with the Hepa vent to the clean area, at the floor) 
Point of use dust collection. having your tools hooked to good vacuums.

Too much can be a nuisance for a variety of reasons.PhilThanks for the input I have been looking at the dry eaze unit.I have a young couple that just bought their first house that's requested that I help them with a couple of projects around the house. I have a small man crew and am trying to slowly start a small business. Most of my clients go to my church. Well this couple has asked me to help them with figuring out how they can update their house. One of the biggest concerns that the wife expressed was that there is no way to clearly define spaces in their house and as a result, the entire bottom floor will have to be painted the same color because all of the walls connect to the different rooms. They're wanting to find a way that they can define their space, but not lose the open floor plan. The wife hates the cut-out wall, but I explained to her that she would be talking about some serious money to remove that. I mean maybe she could get rid of that and do pony walls at the entrance of the house and then have another one coming out from the sliding glass area separating the dining room from the kitchen. 
I just have no clue how to explain to this couple that they are talking about changing their entire floor plan by doing this and yet they still want it open. Any thoughts on how you would tackle this? This is a picture taken from the combined living/dining room to show the hallway and cut-out wall. On the other side of the cut-out wall opposite side of the door, there's an open space separating the "dining room" from the kitchen. There's a sliding glass door on that back wall where the dining room is. The hopes is that they could separate this "dining room" from the kitchen. Hope that makes sense....

This is the other side in case you needed a better visual.That's a good one. Interior design deals with this HO's types of concerns. Architecture deals with floor plans. Remove the wall, and you still have an interior design issue for the HO.Sounds like they are using you to figure out what they can/can't do. Typically they will waste countless hours of yours then decide they can't afford any of it, leaving you wishing you had made some money somewhere along the line.Aztec Decks
Oshawa deck builderI totally agree with it being an interior decorating issue they're probably having. The wall is staying, but at the same time I can see how they have to be frustrated with having all these walls connected and I would want to break it up somehow too if it was my house. We've already discussed budget and I gave them only an hour to sit down and tell me their likes and dislikes. They just want me to email them an idea of what I think they should do and include my price and then they'll yay or nay it. They go to my church so I don't see them jerking me around because there isn't a lot of churches in our area they could move to if they did. I've just been racking my brain trying to figure out how to separate just one room from the others. I think since there's a sliding glass door on the opposite side of the entry, I wouldn't want to put any type of pony wall there. I'm debating the idea of columns or beams.

Chances are your first big project wi be that way. 
Youve already discussed budget? How much do they have to work with? How many walls can you move with their budget?

People usually have no idea what all is involved in moving walls. Heck they probably think you can just slide them on over and be done with it.

Consultations and estimates are two separate phases of a project.

Estimate = what do you want to do? Estimate what that will cost. 

Design consultation is why interior designing is an actual industry with specialists who get degrees and certifications. I charge for even my design work.

My current plan is to hand it all off to my wife when she gets her certificate. She'll also freelance for other connectors contractors and vendors.Tried & True on Facebook

She's affordable and there are two big perks for me; if they won't pay her then they wouldn't pay me and it's a non-starter; if I design it, sometimes I don't want to build it when I'm done. That second one has happened a few times and it really sucks to go through all that, and charge for it, and not want the project.

Looking at a job where I'll be pulling up tile attached to backer board attached to subfloor. 

Assuming the backer is thinsetted to the subfloor and nailed/screwed off properly is this going to be a complete nightmare to pull up? I'm guessing it will come up in chunks if I'm lucky.

The tile is five years old and doesn't have any cracking in the grout joints so I'm assuming that it was done right.

Anyone have any experience in ripping up tile and backer board???

I'm scared.Removing tile and backer board

You should be scared! I would not want to remove any of my installs and if your job was installed right it can be very tough to remove.

I would try with just a flat bar or crow bar first.

Failing that I would chip cut through the grout joints with a diamond blade on the skill saw set to the depth of the tile and backer board. Do not cut into the subfloor in this process or you will hurt the blade and weaken the floor.

Good luck. It is going to be messy... And loud...JohnFRWhipple said:

Click to expand...

 
thats what i'm thinkingWe generally attack that with an sds chipper with the flat bar attachment. It has a nice profile that allows it to get under. Most times with a good install, you will need to pull up the tile first and then remove as many screws as possible before pulling up the backer. It is quite a mess and very time consuming. The screws make it impossible to pull up in any sizable chunks.As far as I am concerned, I pull the tile up with a chipping hammer. Skill saw the underlayment and subfloor out. Its a lot cheaper in man hours vs. materials to lay a new subfloor. The hours you will have in it trying to take it out versus the ten minutes cutting the whole shebang out and hour putting down a new one. 

I messed with it a few times and now I won't touch it unless I replace the Subfloor.I had to rip out a perfectly good floor that I had installed about 5 years previous. New owners bought the house and did not like the traditional bath I had built for the previous owners, who, by the way, were the ones who gave my name to the new owners. When the new owners called, I remembered the street...pulled up to the house...yep, been here before!
I was hoping they wanted something else done, but, no, they wanted a more modern feel.

It took 6 hours to rip out a 5x10 floor - 2 guys! Probably would have been better to take out the entire floor as previously posted!Bathrooms Built for Life.

So about $500 in labor costs with overhead or $30.00 in materials, a $20.00 saw blade or two, and $50.00 in labor costs. Hmmmmm

B,B,We had to demo one about a year ago. It was on 1/4" backer board thinsetted down. We tried an SDS chipping bit, but it turned out that the best thing was just to thump it with a sledge hammer worked up and down just like an ice chisel. Came right up. Lots of worrying and gnashing of teeth over that demo, but it wasn't bad at all. Hope you have a similar experience.When concrete board is installed properly it definately doesn't like to come out! I use a sledge to break the initial bond as well as possible, then my demo hammer behind it. Sometimes my cup wheel is a handy tool to for final cleanup of screws and such.

It is definately easier to demo poor installs.Aaron Tritt

Do you have to remove the entire second floor? As in, is it all new.

When removing the second floor do you take it all off or just down to where it can be properly inspected?

The house has no foundation, 4” of good old 40 year concrete, even still house is still standing with no signs of settelingI took the refresher class this morning (4hrs). Not a lot has changed. Cost $200 for the class and $300 for the EPA. I hope i'm doing the right thing. I can look across the street from one of my jobs and see guys scraping, sanding, using a torch to remove paint down to the bare wood on a house that is a 100 yrs. old. It is very frustrating.

I recently attended the refresher course for my renewal. Cost $195.00 plus an additional $300.00 to renew my EPA Firm certification for another 5 years (this will be my last time)

So $500 to jump through another hoop and most homeowners don't care.

I recently lost a painting job that required a good amount of prep work to a couple with children (both doctors) in an older home (1920's) and their concern for lead paint went out the door when I gave them my price.

There are a ton of illegal painters, general contractors, handymen who do most of the in and out work requiring no permits.

The project I mentioned was referred to me by my designer. She told me the person who did the work was less than half my number and got cash.

I got the HEPA vac, RRP supplies, paper work, and even did a couple RRP jobs, but it's not worth it when I see day laborers across the street in the same neighborhood scraping paint and smashing window and door casings on the same '69 built homes without a clue or the slightest interest in keeping the dust to a minimum.

Click to expand...Unfortunately I do most of my work in older homes but the majority involves complete guts so there's nothing left to clean/swipe within the project area at the end of the job. Just need to contain which we always did before RRP. 

The painting job I mentioned above was restricted to one room with lots of wall and wood prep. Following RRP is much easier when contained to a section of the home. We always did a detailed cleanup before RRP, now it's just a matter of doing a final swipe and maintaining the paper work. 

The price quoted was what a legitimate company needs to charge to cover employees, costs and to make a living here on Long Island. Taxes, taxes and more taxes. RRP was a small part of the cost, so basically RRP or not they still would not have hired me. I'm not defending RRP that the additional cost was not a factor, just pointing out the difference in cost (for the most part) would not have changed the outcome. However, if I had to go through every room in the home to replace windows or some other type of work that required me to set up numerous small areas, that would have killed my chances of getting the job due to RRP.

RRP/EPA is just another sledge hammer over our heads, we also have OSHA, Dept of Labor, State Comp. Board, Fed/State/Local taxes, licensing, etc.. waiting to slam us with something. Nobody walks a straight line.Hi folks,
I'm in the process of doing a reno on a 200 year old post and beam building. I want to support the floor with new lally columns, which will replace the 8" square post which are there now. Most of them are sitting on the concrete floor and I don't see any signs of stress on the concrete. However I was planning on digging through and pouring new footings in sonnet tubes like a deck. 

Since I'm an exterior guy I'm a bit wet behind the ears here and could use some advice from you pros. All responses appreciated

Thanks in advance

The size of the footing is related to the load you spread to the ground. A 2x2 is not any kind of definite answer but will probably carry most residential load no problem. The correct procedure would be to install a footing below the slab, install the column then lock it place with the finished slab.Thanks.

Yes it will be sufficient.

Correct me if Im wrong here but with adjustable lally's you lose load percentage the farther it is adjusted, so that might be something to keep in mind. Also maybe rebar in those new pads, no?we only used the adjustable to raise the floor. we're using standard 4 " concrete filled for the permanent ones

Check out the Lally Column web site 
Spring Field PlateAre the columns being used here 4 inches wide? I have seen 3 inch ones and 4 inch ones available. Like these..I have only used 4" when permanent. And they were not adjustable.

I dig out a footing then position the column up under the bracket by the beam. I hold it up off the hole in the floor by clamping 2 2x4 or 2s around it across the opening. One on each side with threaded rod doing the clamping. Then throw some rebarin the concrete as I fill the hole monlithically.Snobnd said:

Only 2'? They don't require you to go down below the frost line?so I only have to drill into the grout and adjust the bar to a 30 degree angle?

If necessary, if I miss the studs I'll put in a plywood block in back of the drywall even if I have to cut a hole in the outside wall siding & sheathing.

Or should I look for tile drilling bits and spare tile squares? I'm pretty gunshy drilling tile. Maybe use a proper bit with a router and very slowly make the holes?You can use these to mount the bars without hitting studs. I used them on an old tile wall that was about 1.25 thick. You can hang on these bars all day long.

Yeah assuming the tile is properly installed and secure, they work fine, I've used similar anchors from Moen. I usually try and grab one stud if at all possible.
Drilling tile is usually fairly easy, unless it's really hard porcelain, in which case it just takes a little more effort and care.tipitop;2814937 said:

Yes that is the one but in 5/16". you start to by holding it at like a 45 degree angle. hold your hands tight as you can on the wall and drill. I kind of guided it with my finger resting on the bit and the wall. I also started it with the drill on low speed. make sure you keep the bit wet so it stays cool.GettingBy said:

Put a couple layers of painters tape where you want to drill your hole, and start the bit slightly angled rather that 90 deg perpendicular to the wall.

If I don't have an assistant, I usually duct tape a small plastic water or soda bottle filled with water right above where I'm drilling the hole, and I have a tiny hole in the bottle so it slowly puts water on the bit.tipitop;2814937 said:

I'll look up ADA guidelines on placement and get on this one.I use zip toggles or wingits, a little painters tape and its good to go. You can easily achieve 200 psf of better.Hi, sorry I posted this same question in the drywall thread, but I didn't get quite the explanation I wanted.

The house I'm renovating is old and like all old houses, settlements has caused it to lean one direction. 

If you measure the height from one side of the floor to the roof, it's the same as the other end. BUT when you laser a line, around the room, and measure down from the roof to the laser line, you notice that one end of the roof is 2 1/2" lower than the other. The thing is, if you measure up from the floor to the laser line on that same side to the laser line,... the floor is also 2 2/1 higher on that side. So like I said in my first sentence... the space between the floor and roof on both sides is basically the same.

So essentially you had a house that was built level, but settlement caused one side to angle downwards.

My question is.... do I fur the ceiling level, if the floor and rest of the house is sloping?

Or do I just make it flat, and not worry about level?

I probably didn't need to ramble on... as I'm sure my title is explanation enough.. but what the hell.

I ask this question because if I level the ceiling, I'll have to drop one side 2 1/2", also if I lower that end, because the floor slopes.. won't if feel like the roof is lowering when I walk towards the side that I lowered 2 1/2", considering the floor is higher on that side, then the opposite?Personally I would just fur it flat. Unless you are going to level the floor too.Aztec Decks
Oshawa deck builderI think you just make it flat for two reasons.

1) It's easier
2) Your not fixing the floor right? So making the ceiling perfect may actually make things look worse overall. We refer to this as making it right to the world.Flat definitely easier unless you are dealing with a bunch of cabinets.2-1/2" seems like a lot. I'm not sure of the linear feet involved, obviously the longer the distance the less it seems.

Have you given any thought to investigating the cause and possible remediation? Is the mud sill rotted in one place, termites, etc. That would possibly equal 2-1/2".

I just think it makes more sense to do it right if possible. With that being said, there are always time and budgetary restraints. But, just my thoughts.JonThank you everyone for your responses.jb4211 said:

Thanks for your advice. 

I haven't noticed anything serious (the area and age (1920's built) make settlement a big reason... Previous craftsmanship as well, there hasn't been much if any regard for flat/level in other area's I've already repaired. and yes budget and especially time restraints are stopping me from taking a different approach, unfortunately.plus if you leveled the ceiling, if the house gets leveled in the future, it'll be crooked again! or in the future people will scratch their heads for hours then tear it out!illbuildit.dd said:

This was my exact thought.Antro, just curious, what could/would be the negative effects of slowly lifting the house back into level, then shoring it up permanently?

And, is there any way you can attach some photos?JonFlat only. 2 1/2" probably isn't too bad to work with, and it'll complicate future evaluations for any jacking if you level it.So I agree on the idea of flat vs level. But he has said its a kitchen. What do you do to not draw attention to it? Make everything follow the slope? Cabinets, counter, splash, crown? Just really curious how any of you would handle this. 

I've done one in an old house that was 1 1-2" and I wasn't happy with how it turned out.My experience with antique homes 1700-1800 is the HO likes the old world charm in the original portion of the structure and are not looking for plumb, level and square. 
In the past we have built up floors to level them out, pad down ceilings, etc. IMHO the challenge is in the design. For example soffits over kitchen cabs. They can hide a fair amount of discrepancy, especially when they have some simple built up trim applied. All of the horizontal lines allow you to cheat and give the illusion of level.Xtrememtnbiker said:

It's a judgement call. Some times you can split the difference and have cabinets between level and existing surfaces. It's OK to not have it look level, plumb, square, but it can't look wrong. If you take up more than ~1/2" with base cabinet install, it tends to be come very noticeable very fast. Same thing with uppers. Trim tweaks are already mentioned, and paint scheme / lighting make a difference. 1" in 10 ft would be tough, but 1 1/2" in 10' probably can't be made to look visually pleasing.I know old homes follow their own set of rules. I've never worked on an old home. But, I have been in plenty and I've seen doors out of square, ceiling and floors out of level, etc. The HOs loved it. They thought it added character like someone mentioned previously. I suppose that "character" is hard to build into a home; nature has to do it.

This is an interesting post as there are some many things to consider regardless of which path is chosen.Jonjb4211 said:

I think it's possible, at least to make an improvement. BUT given the price range of the house, I'm not sure if it's worthwhile to put much more time/expense into it.Thanks for all the responses.I just leveled a ceiling in an old 1920's house. It showed up out of level on a couple of openings. It was 2x8s spanning 15 feet under a second floor. It had sagged a strong inch in the last 95 years. Homeowner wanted it level so lasered it in and framed it level. There was an old plaster wall midspan upstairs, [causing the sag], that we tore out and drywalled. We also leveled the floor upstairs using stair stepped plywood and slc. maybe not the best way to do it, but without tearing down the house and reframing, the only way. I figure it will last another hundred years.mike gunderson said:

If you take out the ceiling below, you can shim the floor (between joists and subfloor) up level as long as it isn't too much. Taking out the ceiling is a lot more work, but sometimes it's worth it.I guess I was in the right forum after all. So my remodelling project has been an on going one at my parents house. My father and I try and spend our weekends and some nights working on it. The house was built in 1815... of course my mother loves this time period and wants the house to look old and rustic... go figure trying to haul a claw foot bathtub up stairs for her and killing ourselves.

well my dad and I are almost done with that bathroom and onto the next one.. well the house has all of the old radiators in the house and she of course wants to keep them so a couple are buried into the walls and I am trying to decide if I should try and display them or if I should try and cover them up or which. Any thoughts or past expiriences?OK fine, now you've got us curious!:laughing:220...221...whatever it takes!Your mom wants to keep them, so I'd say display.

The big question is how they became recessed - original install, or was the wall built out??Radiators aren't ugly. If they fit the theme of the bathroom, I'd have them displayed even if they didn't work.

JMO.

Need pics!!!!!:thumbup:220...221...whatever it takes!I will post some pictures when I get a chance. Whoever owned the house prior to them did some funky work... shelving paper out of manilla folders... nothing is square... then again I found a paddle and bottle of holy water under a loose floor board so it has been an interesting remodel so far.My customers that have them prefer them covered, whatever I build then becomes a place to display, sometimes bookcases. Most of them are outside the wall not in a cutout inside the wall.I like the old radiators: like the looks and like standing next to one. They were the glove, boot and hat drying rack growing up. Many times standing over one warming the hands.

If it's what Mom wants...gotta do it."We'll be fine"It seems like I get a lot of opportunities to replace tub showers. 

This usually involves:
-cutting out drywall around the existing unit
-demo old unit
-address plumbing
-insert new 4 piece unit
-re-drywall and mud
-I hook up drain and new shower fixture

Usually the HO takes care of paint afterwards.

I typically figure 3 days by myself, but I haven't done enough to say I'm really proficient at it.

I also get some were it is an old cast iron tub with plaster on the walls. So far I have been passing those up. It makes me nervous when I have a wall thickness on both sides around an inch, and not knowing for sure what the RO is between the studs.

Do you guys like these jobs? Any tips for moving them along faster. Is three days in line for a one man show?Lewis CarpentryYou are figuring it about right for a one man crew.

Protect home---demo to dumpster--6 hours--add new mixer valve--2 hours

replace drains if needed ??3 to 4 hours---install tub and sides---3 to 4 hours

Drywall work---3 to 4 hours or more

Caulk---? 
Floor repair if tub size is different???

Do not be afraid of plaster walls--the rough opening is still 5 foot--and a few 2x4s will correct that if it is not---the big challenge with the plaster installs--they are old--meaning the plumbing is also obsolete---

Keep your dads phone number on speed dial--his plumbing experience might save you a lot of time---Sounds about right Spencer. You'll find ways over the years to even reduce your time whether it be through tools or techniques. I would figure 3 days with one guy. I might be able to get it down in one long day with my carpenter. We would have everything ready for the unit by lunch. It's all down hill after that.Tried & True on Facebook

Click to expand...I must get a call a week to do pretty much this exact same thing. With me and one helper, we have the demo done, the new tub set and hooked up to drain, and the new mixer valve installed in a good size day. If we're tiling, we'll stay until the backer board is up and a good coat of RedGard is on too. This is assuming we didn't have to do a lot of extra crap to get the drain setup right. 

Second day is throwing up the surround, putting in the trim kit for the control valve, trimming out edges of the shower if needed, throwing a piece of vinyl quarter round along the edge of the tub (where it meets the floor), and other miscellaneous stuff. 

If we're tiling, we'll get tile up in the morning, head somewhere else, and come back day three to grout. 


Your time line is about right for one man, I'd say. 

And I'll tell ya, having to put furring strips up on one wall or the other to get a perfect fit for the tub is not unusual at all.www.alchemyconstruction.coIt depends a lot on access and what's there. 2 days if it's smooth with a direct to studs 2 piece coming out and direct to studs going in, 3+ for more complicated.

Thanks. I have also done them in two days under the right conditions, but if something goes wrong that requires trips to town or who knows what, it can quickly tack on another day.Lewis CarpentryA lot of the houses around here only have 1 full bathroom and a half bath. When we do them, I tell the homeowners they won't have a shower for 2 days. We gut it, and repair the floor on the first day, plumbing and set the shower first thing on the second day. Then electrical and insulation to finish the second day. That way they really only can't take a shower 1 day. Then drywall day 3 and 4. Tile 4 and 5. Trim day 6, paint day 7, set the vanity and toilet and finishing touches day 8. 

That's if everything goes smooth.I'm currently doing one. Today I removed drywall around tub cut surround into 3 pieces to remove and then lifted old tub out. Went and got the new tub and surround then removed old valve and waste. Installed new valve and waste and set tub in place bedded on plaster . I started at 10 and left at 5. 

Tomorrow is set wall panels, install drywall and corner beads. Mud walls and sand. Add some baseboard and qtr round and pick up check hopefully. 

But I got a feeling I'm gonna be there for a 3rd day finishing up.www.thecoastalcraftsman.comI've done several solo. Takes me 3-4 days start to finish. Expect reroute of plumbing. Don't forget vapor barrier if outside wall. Also, don't forget mortar under the tub for solid support.

Be prepared for big problems. They could and did install those with a ledger for the back lip to sit on, and the skirt on the floor as the only support The floor may need some significant leveling, although it could just be rotten.:whistling

The walls don't have to be plumb or square, either, they could take up the slop with the tile job. The worst one I did the tub didn't fit in the space, so they cut all the studs off in the wall at one end and left the ends hanging in space...hdavis said:

wall panels are strong but my complaint is the ordering system. i find it difficult to understand the number system making some parts easy to miss. you have to order 5' backwalls for 4' showers. stay away from veritek units unless they've beefed them up as they would probably arrive damaged anyway. if your distributer has a good counterperson this should help alot. fabrication is in ILL and delivery is sometimes lengthy which is why you don't want to miss any parts. if you want i could fax a net price list but good luck figuring it out i've only seen pictures of the newer textured walls and they look great, but have not seen them personallyI get requests for this stuff everyonce in awile but have yet to actually install any.

That's interesting, from what you are saying I get the idea you mean the customers who want it are cheap? Swanstone isn't inexpensive, so I can't see that.

The usual scenario for customers who bring it up are they have 4" glazed tile with ugly grout and they want something with a solid surface because they don't want any grout lines to mess with. For us the alternatives on shower surrounds are DTS units which are the least inexpensive option we offer, then custom tile then Swanstone... In the usual scenario I usually explain the difference between what they have 4" tile with old crappy grout that was probably never sealed and what we do now with new underlayments, larger tile and proper grout that is sealed properly and the majority of them if they want something better than a DTS unit opt for tile. 

Now I got lazy with this customer and just said, sure if you want it, we will install it. However, now I'm going to have to deal with the stuff I guess. I've got all the sample kits and brochures for it, but have never really set up and pricing on it or the material or the labor so I'm really curious about what all it takes to do a proper installation.bathroom remodeling - Denver, Lakewood, Littleton, Arvada, Westminster, Centennial, Highlands Ranch, Lone Tree, Englewood Colorado.

Yes, tile with..............EPOXY grout! Epoxy is a simple solution to those HO complaints about mildew in grout. Epoxy is impervious to stains, water penetration, etc.

Epoxy is more expensive ($100 per unit). 1-2 units will cover most average sized baths.

Epoxy is also harder to work. Instead of one guy, you need two. You need plenty of fresh water (like 15 gallons...instead of 1 or 2 for typical portland based grout). You need to really keep wiping and cleaning. 


It is just my opinion that Swanstone looks hotel grade. No offense. My experience with the HO that wants Swanstone is again just my experience.

You may end up liking the stuff, Mike. I think the stuff is a logistical problem that effects the bottom line in my opinion.Looks like some pros were here.swanstone B+

first of all its not that cheap,it is very easy to install,not the best looking but done properly it will last many years.i found the lip on the trim pieces to big ,i had to rip them down to fit snug on the wall,panels were 1/4" ,trim recess was 1/2" to 5/8" ,even with adhesive ,still to big.I've combined the best of both worlds once and bought 1/2 corian and scored 6" x 6" sqaures in it,looks like tile but no cracking grout lines,its a little more money but it looked great,i've done it on counter top back splashes too. theres my 2 cents

Patients grasshopper :whistlingLearning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.We are a Swanstone certified fabricator. We have been installing Swanstone products for several years. The packaged (boxed) products are great. Where else can you find a matching shower wall, shower pan, and sink/countertop setup that looks great? Swanstone has both solid surface and fiberglass products. Both are excellent. Far superior to Sterling or other builder grade brands. Swan products are more expensive. We really like their shower pans since they don't break out around the drain after a couple of years like most cheap fiberglass pans do.interesting stacy we're also certified (7yrs) and most of our fab is kitchen counters. we were dissapointed w/ veritek products due to the thin walls which arrived damaged on two orders and lets face it they only had to ship 180 miles. we sent them back to the shop for beef up rather than wait then insisted on a rebate from swan. on sterling products we open boxes uopn delivery.We don't do Veritek. They don't ship it into our state - Alaska - due to soooo many shipping problems. We have been the only fabricator in the state for several years.

We've done some cool showers and kitchen countertops. But now our market has shifted to mostly granite, so we don't get many requests for Swan anymore. 

The one great thing I like about Swan solid surface I forgot to mention was the ability to withstand chemicals and heat which is great for bathrooms.Mike Finley said:

 :thumbup:I miss Mike Finley.-JohnWho was Mike?I have tried looking for this and could not find this type of setup. I went to an EXACT model and saw this ventilation setup. Over the range is vented outside, and I am assuming it is going thru the wall between studs up the ceiling between joist to exterior. (2 stories)

My house does not have this. And the oven recirculating the air. I have notices the following:
I did see an exterior vent cap, and it is in the same place as the home mentioned above.
The problem is cabinet back veneer is covering the wall, before I pull that cabinet I wanted to get an opinion here as to the setup in the photo. The reason I am sure I have the duct in place is because the vent cap outside is present on mine, and they are exact model.

I am thinking of the following: remove the Microwave, cut bottom of the cabinet to align it to the vent on microwave, switch the fan position to kick air out. ALSO, I think I need to cut the back of the cabinet which I am thinking of going into the wall, NOT SURE.

Now I am lost, do you think when I pull the oven out and the pull the cabinet, I will see the vent in place between the studs or do you think I have to cut the drywall?

What type of Duct is used which looks like a box, how should I install it.? Size and place to buy?

Also, I know everyone hates OTR Microwave, do you think should I buy a standalone or this will work incase it is going thru the studs, if I change it to standalone would that help termendously?

On a remodel, the cabinets should come out first. 

The customer should be informed this is really the only way to preclude future problems. If the customer chooses not to, mention of that should be in the contract, otherwise it could come back to haunt the installer. A future owner could demand that the installer come back and do the job properly. 

"Workmanlike Manner" is included in all contracts whether mentioned or not. That requires meeting industry standards and that includes under-counter height that is appropriate for ranges and dishwashers. The next guy in has every right to expect that industry standards were maintained. 

If the HO does not do this, he is obligated to inform future buyers of this deficiency but first the installer is obligated to inform the consumer.Patriotism is being loyal to your country all the time and your government when it deserves it.

_______________You should be fine then.www.thecoastalcraftsman.comI ve been hired to GC a project with a house built in 1953. The houses sheathing is homasote and the siding contractor is proposing to side with prodigy over the existing homasote only. I know that hardi plank defiantly can't be installed over homasote. I don't know much about the prodigy but I still think plywood sheathing would be the way to go.Any insight would be appreciated. Thankswhy can't Hardie be installed over Homasote?TomThe siding contractor said hardie is too heavy and would void the manufacture warranty .The stuff is only 1/2 thick right ? Not seeing how Hardi would be to heavy if nailed properly and on studs. 

I have only see Prodigy one time on a Habitat house I worked on and was not inpressed by it. Was a red color and buckled on the south side.The client likes that prodigy has insulation too. It's not my decision. So you think either application is ok to install on homasote which was used for sheathing?Certainteed (Allura now) let's you install their fiber cement on rigid foam up to 1" thick.

It is nice to have ply or osb under the siding, but it can be a real pain resheathing a old house though, Although it can be a pain siding a old house with only fiber board or such too.I personally wouldn't leave homasote if it were mine.expesially because of the fact of the house not being very efficient. The insulation in the kitchen which was removed during demo was shot and had 65 years of dead mice .It could be re-insulated when homasote comes down.They need 2 oil tanks for their heat! Home owners have a lot on their plate and their trying to cut cost. I don't think this is where to do it. I allready told them this once and they said insulation in the prodigy will help enough. So I guess at this point I just bite my tongue and move on. Thanks for your input.some siding like the shake panels need a solid nail base,others can be stud nailed, however there are some places on a wall like in between windows or windows and corners where there may only be one or depending on trim no available stud.TomI've got a really good customer that wants to get his house ready for sale. They have an old brick fireplace/chimney that is in pretty rough shape. They would like to tile around the fireplace and 8' up the wall above.

The brick is totally uneven, so I'm going to strap the face of it and put backer board over for the tile. I'll probably use a Tapcon (or similar brand) to attach the strapping.

My question is if I need to worry about heat from the fireplace or chimney cracking the tile, or damaging the wooden strapping.

I'll add pictures right away.Here is the fireplace in question. I just saw there are several threads already about this same subject. I might look into skim coating the brick and tiling over top. I just need to see how it all looks under the drywall.

Again though, is heat a concern?I'd use Durock and metal hat channel...forego the wood. Or just lath and gauging until flat and plumb if it ain't that bad."Under promise, over deliver and all that!" JBM

https://www.facebook.com/Superseal-Construction-162699413750013/Agreed, I'd skip the wood. 

Is it a working fireplace or "ornamental" (gas logs)? We did one of the latter a while back and haven't gotten any reports of tile problems.I just finished mine today. I'll grab a pic after dinner. I was lucky enough that most of the brick only lipped an 1/8". A coat of primer, skim coat of UltraFlex2, and 1/4" trowel the tile on after the skim coat dried. Troweled the tile and the skim coat.

I wouldn't Durock it if the brick is really uneven. I would grind down the high spots and skim coat.Tried & True on Facebook

Thanks! That was a tremendous helpI have a question on how much slope is needed on a ceiling in a shower that is going to have a steam unit installed? The shower itself is 5'x5'. The tile company we are getting tile from is telling me min. 1" per ft. This just sounds a little drastic. Wanted to get opinions on this before I proceed. Also I think it may look a bit odd too walking in and seeing that much slope on the ceiling with the tile lines, because we are doing a 4" marble "border" about 12" from the ceiling at its lowest point. Thanks.:thumbup:Hey Eric,

It depends on who you talk to. Most contractors I know don't slope the ceiling in residential steam showers, especially smaller ones like yours, as it takes roughly 45 minutes for enough water to condense to start dripping, and generally a steam shower is less than that, most recommend 15 to 20 minutes maximum. 

Some contractors say a minumum slope of 2" per foot, prefering to slope with the shortest dimension. I have done a few steam showers, only one was requested to be sloped, none of the level ones have ever had a problem with condensation dripping that I have heard about, as I continue to do work for most of the people.

My last house had a steam shower, tile ceiling, no slope, and never a problem. A friend has one with a slope, his complaint is that as the water starts to condense, it runs down the tile to the grout joints, collects along the edge of the tile, and starts dripping from them versus a level ceiling being flat and the condensation being more evenly distrubuted and taking longer to form droplets. If you had a flat surface material like Corian or such, the slope might be useful as it can run all the way to the wall, but it doesn't seem to make much difference with tile and grout joints. 

Then there is the look of the tile as well. You would have a 5" to 10" drop across the shower depending on what slope you choose, do you have the headroom to do that? And the look of the wall tiles cut at the angle of the sloped ceiling along with the marble, how will that look?:blink: -Mike- 
Falcon Contracting​Residential - Commercial​http://www.falconcontracting.biz​The overall look is what Im worried about. The shower has 8' ceiling in it. Im just going to have to have the HO make the call. Present the pros and cons then let him decide. Thanks for the insight.Hi Eric,
The Tile Council of North America says "minimum 2" per foot". Not putting a slope in a steam shower lid is negligence. Doesn't make a bit of difference if it's a commercial spa or a residential unit at the Summer house you never use. Build it like it's gonna be used, because that's what we get paid for. If they can't afford it being built right, then they simply can't afford it at all. Next!
Aesthetically, that's another ball game. The pitch makes it nearly impossible to run continuous joints through the ceiling, though I have cut down stone to align joints and that's worked well in the past. The easiest solution is a border with a diagonal panel on the ceiling or to use a different dimension entirely. I've put mosaic on lids and that looked nice too.

This is correct. And we ALWAYS put shower, steam shower ceilings on point. The customer will never be happy the other way.And now is my opportunity to eat a little crow. 
Got a call to look at a project yesterday and I'll probably try to get it. It's the kind of installation that ends up in magazines and I'd like the challenge as well as the portfolio shots. But here's the rub; the client and GC are both very clear that the lid-pitch is going to be very slight. Probably less that 1" per foot if they have their way. I said my peace about required pitch and the GC was sympathetic but said that the client wants otherwise and that they will both sign off on the reduced pitch, so do I slip my conscience into my pocket on this one or do I just push for the recommended pitch????
Yup, I'll send them numbers for the shower they want and not the one I would prefer to build. Just goes to show you that as soon as you get up on your high horse, it's time to climb back down and take a squat.

How many of you have used a steam shower? I was recently in a commercial spa steam room with a perfect tiled ceiling sloped at 2:12. As mentioned in another post, the drips all lined up neatly along the grout lines perpendicular to the slope, and rained down from there. (That being said, they weren't all that frequent, or uncomfortable).

It is pure negligence to charge a client for something that is unnecessary, just because the "Council" says so.

Unless someone can provide a better reason than "because they said so," I can't imagine frivolously adding unnecessary complexity to a job. 

Perhaps sloping would be ok without the horizontal grout lines, but I would really like to know the real reasons, and exactly under what conditions they apply.Zombie Thread...after 7 1/2 years...that is a record in my books.Tried & True on Facebook

Click to expand...That sure is, but in any case The ceiling must slope at least 2” minimum per foot to prevent water from dripping on steam room occupants (per Tile Council of North America recommendations). The floor should be pre-pitched (prior to the installation of the shower pan liner) at the rate of 1/4" per foot toward the drain... not to mention have to meet all the plumbing codes and ASTM approved materials should be used for liners, etc.I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​Well since this dead post is alive, I'll throw my 2 cents in. I agree with firemikes opinion. Steam showers is where I disagree with TCNA the most. There should be a residential recommendation and a commercial recommendation. The pitch is excessive, imo. And it's a recommendation, not a "Steam Shower Law."I am taking the business and law exam through prometric to get a Lee county specialty contractors license(AKA certificate of competency). has anyone on here taken this specific test?

Robert B.camtech school, they have all the books etc, google themStill "Shakin" the tree bossI need some help brain storming solutions to an existing problem on one of my customer’s houses. Here’s the situation:

•	North side of the house.
•	Structural concrete “deck” (covers the patio below from a walk-out basement).
•	The concrete deck is at sill height of the doors that walk out on to it.
•	There is a slight slope away from the house – not much but some.
•	There is a railing on the outside of the deck. It has some weep holes to allow water to run off.
•	When it snows the snow is shoveled to the railing side – blocking any drainage to the weep holes.
•	The deck becomes an ice skating rink when it’s cold.
•	The basement takes in water when the ice melts and the trims on the house sit in a pool of water (you can see some of the rot in the pictures).

Is the only solution to tear this POS off the house and start over?I love what I do and I'm very good at it!

Btw, actual dimension of this sink is 22 1/8" x 25 1/8" rectangle, nothing fancyI was initially thinking heat gun too. Then have a helper tap a Putty knife under the edge as you go along. Then I'd switch to a bigger pry bar after the knife cuts through the crap.

As you start to get it up place something underneath so it doesn't start to re-glue back down .Cut it out from inside the bowl near the rim, with an angle grinder, you can then remove the rim from inside edge.tipitop;2814937 said:

I would have to apply force to the bowl unless I modify it somehow, but I like it. :thumbsup:Had a similar situation.

Double bowl SS sink.

Set up a couple of heat lamps shining into the bowls.

Underneath set a 2x4 under both drain holes.

Placed a small bottle jack in the center of the 2x4 with moderate pressure on the 2x4 and went home.

Little more pressure the next morning and by lunch the sink popped up.

Was a mess to clean up but all came loose with no problems.

Don't forget to cut all the plumbing loose.Torch and a jack seems like the safest approach. I'd throw a piece of scrap ply under the jack to spread it out and reinforce the bottom a bit. Jack one edge of the bowl gradually and torch that end of the flange, and the sides. Once you get it raised up a bit, shim it and move the jack to the other side.

That was nice of them to use adhesive. :no:Jaws;1780140 said:



Planer.....

Click to expand...I'd be careful with heat it can crack granite. I'd heat the SS.Another way to do it without putting any pressure on the sink base cabinet bottom . Place a piece of 2x4 on each side of the sink , then put a 2x4 across the top of the sink and resting on the 2x4s on each side of the sink . Drill a hole in the top of the 2x4 centered over the drain and place a threaded rod down through the top of 2x4 and at least 6'' below drain hole . Place another 2x4 with a hole drilled through it and put it underneath the drain with the threaded rod through it . At each end of the threaded rod put a large washer and nut and tighten until snug . Then heat it with a torch and tighten the top nut slowly until you have a good amount of pressure . Keep heating it until it pops , probably the safest way without scratching the granite .griz said:

Same here. Patience is key. It's the same as taking down a large glued mirror in once piece. Slight and prolonged pressure and then it will eventually give. I like the heat lamp idea Griz.220...221...whatever it takes!rselectric1 said:

I am currently riding a very successful streak of mirror removals. I posted some pics last year of a condo remodel with a 70's motif. We removed about 20 large mirrors there, and I have added about a dozen since then. 

The ironic part is, we tried to donate them to habitat, and they wont take mirrors here. So I ended up smashing them in the dumpster.Warren said:

Yeah, Habitat for being a "needy" organization seems to be pretty picky.

I usually end up smashing them in the dumpster too, but I figure that the 45 minutes it sometimes takes to coax the bigger ones away from the wall outweighs the time spent cleaning up the mess when they break as well as I know that nobody is going to get hurt from an errant shard.

I actually like the challenge. That process is all done by listening to the intensity of the "sound" of the glue (or drywall paper) releasing. When it quiets down a slight bit more pressure and repeat over and over. To me it's like popping a zit!!!!:laughing:220...221...whatever it takes!Warren said:

Click to expand...Greetings all.

I'm doing a small remodel on a 100 year old home to use as rental property. There is zero insulation in the walls. The walls have the original lath and plaster with 1/2" drywall over that. I really don't want to tear all that out and open the walls. I'm not a big fan of blowing in insulation from the outside. For one, it's too expensive for this project and I know there can be issues with putting insulation in the walls of old houses because there's no vapor barrier behind the plaster. I know there are many opinions on the subject. I've opened the walls of old houses before to find the insulation wet and moldy due to the lack of a moisture barrier on the inside. I thought perhaps I could install 1" foil faced foam board over the existing walls, fur it out and install 3/8" drywall over that. I know the R-value would be minimal, but it's better than zero R-value and should help at least some to slow down the heat transfer. My concern is, will this also create a moisture problem. Will moisture be trapped between the foam board and the new sheetrock? Any and all opinions would be appreciated. Thanks.Where are you from?NKLHDYou need to convince me that you are really a contractor, then I will offer my advice.NKLHDI'm in Central Illinois.Blow insulation from insideWe'll give your home a NEW IMAGE

Well, I'm not exactly sure how I can convince you, but I've been a contractor for 30 years. I was a sub-contractor for a home builder early on in my career for 8 years before I went on my own. I do small residential remodels (kitchens, baths, etc.) but mostly manage rental property, doing the maintenance, repairs and turn overs. I own a few rental properties myself and just picked up this house I'm working on now.jaydee said:

My concern with blowing in insulation whether it be from the inside or the outside is the issue of creating a moisture problem since there's no vapor barrier behind the plaster. I have seen evidence of this problem when I've opened up walls in older homes that had insulation blown in.

Hey there. You're actually in my town. Yeah, I realize I'll have to extend some outlets and it would only affect one window which I just replaced, so it's not trimmed out yet. And actually, it's not all the exterior walls. The house has had much newer additions added to two sides of it, so those walls became interior walls. I also thought by adding furring strips over the foam it would create an area of dead air space between the sheetrock and foam that would add additional R-value to it.CaptainRon said:

The issue isn't lack of a vapor barrier but rather air leakage & screwy flashing details, well and high indoor humidity, plumbing leaks, ancient wiring...SLS Construction & Building Solutions LLC Our Blog - The HTRCOpinion On Adding Foam Board Insulation On The Interior Over Existing Drywall.

Yank the interior finish and insulate it right. Like mentioned it is air leaks and not so much vapor barrier that cause issues. You can do a pretty good job of air sealing and insulating if you gut the interior and do it right. I wouldn't even consider what you are thinking. Complete waste of time."Hey there.

Repairs, rehabs, etc. I realize what I'm purposing to do is far from the optimal solution, but I just hate tearing out old plaster walls, especially when they've also been covered with drywall.

Just think, you can re-live your youth.:thumbsup:Trump-The "Con Man's" Con Man.I'm assuming this is balloon framed.

Step 1: get rid of any water leaks / moisture sources

Step 2: air seal. Keep in mind, some of the old plaster interior and exterior walls will be open clear into the attic

Before step 3, make sure you don't have knob and tube in the walls. Also make sure you know how ceilings are handled - you can have some major difficulties blowing into ceilings.

Step 4 : blow the walls OR put the foamboard on the outside OR trench all the ceilings and put the foam board continous on the inside walls (except for the subfloor, etc.

If all you need is a vapor retarder, use a vapor retarder paint on the exterior walls - tear out just to put a 6 mil plastic sheet in place is a little overkill, IMO.

There is no cheap, easy, fast solution. Putting the foam board on the inside pretty much keeps you from blowing the walls later.This question is interesting, in that I personally don't care for too many windows, or too much sunlight. I pretty much had privacy black out blinds on my windows, and it has stayed that way for years. Probably because I like to sleep in on my days off! 

Im looking at a kitchen/bathroom/living room reno job, top floor, and was told "I want lots of light"- issue is, that its not a big place, and has a E/W windows only. (the north side doesnt get direct, and S side has no windows, semi attached). 

My thoughts are pretty simple- Add a few recessed to the living room (4 for a 15x15. , 1 solar tube over the kitchen island, 1 solar tube in the hallway, 1 solar tube in the bathroom. For the island have two side by side 4" recessed next to the solar tube, and 3 in the kitchen.

Is this too much for a small room? Im thinking no, but would like your opinions.Depends.
It's easier to block light out with shades or shutters than it is to add windows after the fact.
Light rooms give the appearance of being larger and dark rooms seem smaller.

My house is passive solar design. The past few days it has been 15deg out side. Temps inside 70-74deg. I use cellular shades to control the amount of direct sunlight and they also insulate at night and in the summer.
I like light.Trump-The "Con Man's" Con Man.When designing lighting, I never rely on sunlight since that's only there half the day.

In a kitchen, for example I follow approximately the 4' spacing (every 3 joists in that direction) and then use 5-6 feet spacing within the joist cavities.

Too much lighting is hard to do, especially with dimmers available. But not enough once you've laid out a symmetrical pattern is NOT an easy fix after the fact.

So to answer your thread title question from my perspective. NO.220...221...whatever it takes!My philosophy is to over light and dim to taste. You can always dim down to your desired level, but you can't make it brighter if you didn't start with enough light in the first place.

Assuming I'm not lucky and there's an extra 2x12 on each tread, it seems like it would be easier to cut them in place with a combination of my RH and LH circ saws and an oscillating tool.

remove treads, cut off 1.5" from every step, install new treads. So I'm making about 17x3=51 cuts. Half as many as cutting 3 new stringers, but in an awkward position and the foot of the saw may hit the ceiling below before I fully make the cut. Assuming there's still enough meat in the stringer, but it's an enclosed stairway.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.Golden view said:

Click to expand...You could just rip the whole existing stringer down in place to below where the new meat line needs to be, and sister new full stringers in. ?? 

Quick rip, minimal oscillating cutting, no precision needed in awkward areas, remaining string reinforces new stringer meat, minimal ceiling damage (maybe leave 1/8 gap @ below), minimal collateral damage to any framing tied in below or @ sides, less looong swear words.

If you do just re cut the tread cuts, try making a tack on saw guide ledger/jig with a bump stop. Set & tack-zing-move guide. Be nice to not have to see and control those cuts. 

Maybe eh?You could probably sneak those cuts with a trim saw and multi tool. Or jigsaw and router clean up. Are you sure you can still have 4.75"? Thats not terrible.

Is it worth knock off the existing triangles then sistering new correct stringers?Have never heard of that being done before. Maybe I am wrong, but wouldn't it make the top and bottom steps different. Say for example the existing rise is 7 inches. When you cut the treads down 1 1/2 inches, the top step will now be 8 1/2 inches, and the bottom step will be 5 1/2 inches. Am I missing something here.And it's still the same amount of cuts as cutting new onesI would rip the existing triangles off but you'd still have to notch each one since you're lowering an 1-1/2 unless you rip it lower assuming there will be enough meat left.muskoka guy said:

He knows better, Im thinking hes fixing someone elses boo booI did something like this with a router - slow but it worked.Skilsaw, jigsaw, and a multitool you could probably be mostly done faster than you can read all of these replies.I can't compete with hacks.A few answers. ALL the steps are currently 1 1/2" too high. The bottom step is huge and the top is tiny. 

River, Avenge, thanks for the suggestions to rip the triangles off. I have no idea why this wasn't my first thought. I can make new stringers on horses pretty fast. This solution would take half the time I budgeted to completely rip out, haul away, rebuild, patch ceiling.

Also Doneright, thanks for reminding me about jig saws :whistling

Find a local fabricator. Stainless should be easy, copper a bit more challenging.

With the natural Anti-Microbial properties of copper, some people really have no other options.

Hey Mad,

Maybe start out small and easy, something like few islands. 

Just to get some experience, maybe the supplier has some tech guy or training videos on youtube?

Even if you only do the easy stuff that will differentiate you from the crowd and help with marketing.

I was looking for some advice as to what trailer to get and what type of organization systems you guys use that may be relevant to me. 

A little about what I do: I own a business where I buy homes, renovate them and resell them. I need a trailer to keep tools, and materials in the trailer so to avoid items from getting thrown out and then being able to haul leftover material to the next home. I pretty much, need room for drills, air compressor, 5 gal paint buckets, spackle buckets, sheet rock, ladders, etc.

Ideally I'd like to order a trailer somewhat soon, I'm leaning towards a 7' x 16' Car Mate trailer with extended height. I'd like to have some organization system in place so that when I drop it off at the home we're working on right now it doesn't get filled up immediately and I have no way of finding anything.

Honestly, I did have concerns about this and I don't really know how else to go about handling my situation. I have subcontractors who work on the homes and need materials and some tools while I'm on appointments with the truck most of the time. Most of the homes I buy are in good areas where breakins and such don't happen on a regular basis, but my other option is to keep the materials in the home and in the past I've had subs mistake them as scrap and/or garbage or it gets "misplaced".if this is your concern then you may look into a smaller trailer for tools and things you need portable, and rent a small storage unit for each job where your material can be kept.I have a 14' and find the only time i wish it was larger is when I'm hauling 16' pieces of trim. I would get the same size again, but go for a 7'tall unit, as I'm 6'3. I doubt I will ever go back to a van or pickup.kunaldoshi said:

The sheetrock caught my eye. I don't own a trailer, but the idea of having a trailer to store and haul sheet rock and similar sorts of materials, doesn't make sense to me.

“When the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.” - Abraham MaslowWell its not just sheetrock obviously, I've been working with a wholesaler for paint so he gets me great pricing on paint if I order 10-15 5 gal buckets, I typically order tiles for kitchens and bathrooms by the pallet, things of that nature. The biggest advantage I see with a trailer other than a place to store materials is free advertising.Tile, paint, and sheet rock I think you need a storage garage of some sort 

Not a little trailer to put the stuff in

Then use the trailer to haul smaller quonteties to each jobRyan 
-----------
www.ryandonohueconstruction.comMy $.02 - IMO, trying to have a trailer big enough for both tools and material storage/hauling is a mistake. Big trailers like that can get crowded and unorganized quick. Using a small(ish) trailer for tools and small material (nails, screws, paint supplies, etc) storage and getting a PODS, or similar, for big material storage would make more sense than hauling a 30' trailer around. I had a truck and 20' trailer many years ago. I got so damn tired of trying to find things I got rid of them and bought a van and 12' trailer. Tools in the van and materials on the trailer. They can get messy quick too, but if I clean/organize them once a week I stay productive by not wasting time (money) looking for things I need.Donohue Const said:



Tile, paint, and sheet rock I think you need a storage garage of some sort

Whatever you get make sure it's climate controlled for the tile and paint. Not sure where you are located, but storing materials in a trailer when the temps drop below freezing for weeks at a time is useless."Also free advertising" is also a way of saying "Steal Me"...I wouldn't be hauling 50 gallons of paint with me at all times. Just sayin. You have to figure out your own costs, but I've found that unless materials are significantly cheaper, and they don't degrade (i.e. nails, screws, etc). Its not worth hauling around dead weight. Its tough on your truck, and bad on fuel economy. Any savings will be negated.Who is usually responsible for installing the tub/shower? I would think it is the plumbers job. I just want to see what you all think.Should be the GC IMO. Plumber to obviously do the rough in but tubs are to be nice and level and fully resting on the floor. If it wouldn't fit I bet they'd get out the sawzall lol.In my area, the plumber.

To answer you're question ,plumber or tile setters do that in this area.Some of the tile setters don't like laying tile over the plumbers work so do it themselves.
You're question is very vague so it's hard to give a good answer.Shower pan,fiberglass one piece,ditra?
I know less about what you're talking about than you do with that info?plumber and his crack:laughing:My plumber will do it either way, but it has to be agreed up front.Around here it depends on what the tub and or shower is. 

If the tub or shower pan is cultured marble, the marble company installs it, the plumber hooks it up. 

If the tub is a standard tub or the pan is a pre-made off the shelf pan, the tub or pan are provided and installed by the plumber. 

The wall finishes are installed by the tile guy or cultured marble guy. If it's a fiberglass tub/shower unit with a separate wall section, the plumber will probably supply it with the tub but expect a carpenter to install it. 

If the shower has a tile floor, the tile setter builds the pan. 

There are probably other scenarios. It's the GC's job to insure everyone is on the same page. That means, it's the GC's job to insure that whoever is doing the work includes it in his bid. 

Oftentimes GC's fail by failing to do their jobs. They then blame their problems on others. The GC needs to insure all bases are covered up front.Patriotism is being loyal to your country all the time and your government when it deserves it. Mark Twainsquare73 said:

Plumber...Since when plumbers installing tubs and shower pans?

The guy who installs kitchens does that.I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​I was letting the plumber set the tubs for man power and responsibilty. I only sell cast iron tubs.
I started resetting them after the plumber places them because he still uses a wall cleat and shims the apron. I prefer steel nail plates under the feet with spray foam to hold them there.

My tiler is much happier when I set it.We (GC) set the tub with the plumber. 
The plumber is more than capable but it our job site. So we do things to our standards.Plumber around here does them. But as per the bid?Plumber, if he is capable. If not then why use him to begin with?plumber :thumbsup:We'll give your home a NEW IMAGE

I should have been more specific, I am referring to fiberglass and/or acrylic units.
The question came to mind because I recently had a plumber install a three piece fiberglass unit and it didn't go well. I'm usually around to help the plumber but I had other work to do and couldn't be there. 
I think if I had been there the unit would be level and there would have been silicon applied as per the manufacturers instructions.
I would think that a competent plumber would be able to handle the job without a "babysitter". I just wanted to know whether or not I'm expecting too muchIn the rare event that I'd call in a plumber instead of doing everything myself, I'd expect him to be a hotshot with the pipework but not much else. With rare exceptions, the ones I've seen aren't nearly as well-equipped as me to set a tub or a sink. Nor are they likely to do it to my standards.

So no, I wouldn't have him do it.Need some info:

Can anyone give me some competitive info on CM shower bases/shower walls. I currently have used Onyx Collection. But they just made my blood boil. I'm looking for direct competitors to them that are good products. Are Onyx shower bases/walls better than others? One product line I've looked at is Swanstone. Any info would be appreciated. 
Thanks
JHCI use a local to me company. Pro Cast. Their web site sucks but they have a great selection.
http://www.procastwi.com/

Same company's site, but shows some of their colors.
http://www.probathaccessories.com/

Don't know how shipping to you would work. Call them and ask.Swanstone is a nice product, has the solid surface advantages. It's rare around here, no one stocks it but I can order it. Turns out the best deal for me was through HD about 40% off list, the other sources were only talking about 30%.
For the onyx, (marbles, cast granite) I go directly to a manufacturer less than an hour away (there are some slightly closer but I like these guys service) Maybe a search for cultured marble in your area, most of those places advertise heavily under that rather than onyx (even their business names always seem to marble in it) I know the guys I use would not ship...but years ago I used to order/get shipments Starrow....but that was through a local mom and pop store/dealer.Don Sheppard Construction
http://www.facebook.com/FairfieldRemodelingI've install many Swanstone shower walls and bases. Good quality product, easy to clean and maintain, comes in many colors.What's the issue you're having with Onyx? I've used both Onyx and Swanstone but mostly Onyx. The issues I have had with Onyx are missing dates for orders when they are really busy but they have bent over backwards to satisfy me. Another issue I had was with a countertop that was wavy on one end. They told me put in the sun to heat it up and shape it back. I told them no and had a new top delivered in 2 days.I've used a lot of the onyx collection as well. They've been fantastic to work with. What was your problem?My problem is that they won't let me buy direct in St. Louis. I'm trying to be competitive on price, but it's tough when you have to buy it after the product has already been marked up from the manufacturer and then the dealer. In addition, I don't like going to my competitor to buy product. The guy also said that in other parts of the country they could sell me direct, but not St. Louis. Serems they have a few good old boy relationships with a select few dealers. I have no problem with the product though.Try home depot.:thumbup:Jay

I spend most of my days in the deck building forums/topics, but I do some remodeling as well. However, my sister-in-law just bought a house that I will be finishing the basement on and have some questions about best practice in this scenario.

The basement walls have been braced with 5" C-channel. I don't have pic of the place, but if you're not familiar, see this (hers is not block): http://www.ecosealsolutions.com/images/bowed-wall.jpg

What would be the best way to frame and insulate this? I was planning to frame on the inside (not between) of the bracing, which would lose a little square footage, but it's a large enough basement and would be quicker to do this way.

But I've got multiple ideas in my head as to how to insulate and VB this. Curious what the super-experienced basement guys would do?Shane C.
Fresh Decks - Regina, SK
http://www.freshdecks.caWell those braces are going to conduct cold. I hope the exterior pressure has been releived. And those cracks are waterproofed with expanding foam. 

I think greg24k specializes in basement repairs. Ask him if its a there is still a concern.

As for finishing, batts in framing are not a good idea even with an air gap behind it. Its better practice to use XPS board foam with caulked seams with 1x strapping over it to hang the rock on. There is also a product system called "In So Fast" check them out.

If the walls are as bowed as that picture you may need to try something else like spray foam and butt framing to it.Yes that's my concern is the steel transferring the exterior wall temp. I can insulate between the braces all day long, but not sure how much problem the cold steel is going to give me.Shane C.
Fresh Decks - Regina, SK
http://www.freshdecks.caThe InSoFast product is likely not a good candidate for this due to the braces right? You couldn't run it continuous along the wall, and couldn't drywall to it because of the braces.

Seeing as though I want the braces on the cold side of any vapour barrier, I'm wondering if I can't just frame to the inside of the braces (inside of the room, not between the braces) leaving a 1" air gap between the steel and studs and use batt insulation between studs which would then be about 6" away from the concrete wall, and if necessary, use 1/2" stricks of rigid adhered to the front face of the steel between the steel and studs.

Would any of that make sense?

I could use 2" rigid between the braces, but then the braces themselves are not insulated and could be potential condensation points and would then not have a barrier before the drywall.Shane C.
Fresh Decks - Regina, SK
http://www.freshdecks.caIf they are ok with it, frame a 2x4 wall in front. As long as you are sure it's dry (have them sign off that they hired someone else to do that and not you) spray foam with closed cell foam at least 1-1/2" thick. That gets you R-10.

This gets all the hard to insulate spots covered and at 1-1/2" gets you a vapor barrier.It is what it is...now fix it.:whistlingAnyone have any good tricks for minimizing the framing around basement duct-work? I need to be as high, tight and light as possible to conserve headroom.I love what I do and I'm very good at it!

Da Vinci on the web or Da Vinci On FacebookUp sell them radiant floors... or ask Matt. he's the basement GURUI was surprised that the AHJ in Tacoma let us screw drywall right to ducts. I would greatly prefer to screw 2x2s together to make a support and as long as the duct is less than 24" wide, you don't need any cross pieces under the duct. The drywall will hold them together/apart. You end up increasing the size of the duct by about 5" in width and 1" in height.You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.Golden view said:

We’ve built what we call “Soffit Ladders” out of 2 x 2s and tied them together (horizontally) with 1 x material. I never thought about omitting the horizontal members though. Thanks ! I think I’d prefer 5/8” rock on the bottom though – to minimize sag in a 2’ span.

Screwing right to the duct work is not an option here (or anywhere that I know of).I love what I do and I'm very good at it!

Da Vinci on the web or Da Vinci On FacebookI snap a line or use a laser to install 2x2's to the floor joists, rip plywood "sides" 1/4" less in height than desired, pull a string line or laser to establish bottom edge of plywood, raise and lower as needed to keep bottom edge of the plywood sides on string or laser line, run 2x4 stretchers on edge between plywood side.

My base height is 1-3/4" below the lowest duct point, this leaves 1/4" air space minimum. You could use 3/4" stretchers on short spans.

I'll see if I have a picture of the install. Very easy to do, not so easy to explain. Don't forget your fire stops.

I use 1-1/2"x 7/16" crown staples to install the pieces.

Use a 3/4" stretcher, saves an inch. You could try as suggested above screwing the rock directly to the bottom edge of the plywood sides.

Rock wool cut to fit snuggly between the 2x2, sub-floor bottom and joist sides. 

For the wall to floor joist area I install 3/4" plywood or 5/8" drywall to the floor joists. One edge is tight to the sill plate and fire caulked, the other edge is set to the room side of the wall framing. The framing is secured to the joists through the fire stop. I know in your area you have to float the bottom plate.

One other thing I learned the hard way a long time ago-----insulate the cold water lines, if not they can sweat, drip on the ceiling and run it. I now insulate all of the water lines.

I run the 2x's on the flat.

TomWe have screwed a 2x to the ceiling on a chalk line. Then we will rip some osb for the side and screw/nail those to the 2x at the ceiling. Next we will screw/nail a 2x2 to the bottom of the side osb. We do this on both sides making sure the 2bys on the ceiling are parallel. Next we rip osb to the width of the distance from side to side and screw it to the bottom 2x2. The entire thing can get drywall screwed anywhere. This method allows us to keep very tight to the ductwork without the 2x2 ladder and keeps everything very straight. It ends up a very strong assembly.It is what it is...now fix it.:whistlingWhat about using exposed grade duct work & paint it if you want?

Change the bottom stretcher to 3/4 to gain as little head room.

1. Take plenty of pictures and document everything that you do. Document every conversation, document every date and time that the dumpster is pulled, and keep a sign-in/sign-out log for everyone who comes on site including the owner and any building/code enforcement official. You don't have to make them sign the sheet. Just make a note of their visits and the time that they are there.

2. Get PLENTY of insurance.

3. Have some extra safety equipment on hand. Hard hats, goggles, masks, earplugs, etc. Your crew will be fine. It's the visitors that you have to worry about.

4. Rent an office trailer until you get to the rebuilding phase. Once the house is dried-in you can move your office to one of the bedrooms. 

5. Rent a porta-potty. 

6. Rent a demolition conveyor belt system to get your debris out of the house and into the dumpster without having to carry and haul it out unless you can have it delivered up against the house making it easy to just toss it out the window.I'm always looking for the answer to my troubles at the bottom of a paint can.Wanttoexit1 said:

They do it all the time my friend, all of the time. Just ask any of the MODs how many threads they shut down per day for that very reason.

As for my brilliance, it's obvious that I am a hell of lot smarter than you. I know my cost, overhead and profit and can sure as hell figure out my own pricing. I don't need to come online to figure it out. I also don't expect others to know my numbers and tell me if what I am charging is in line. You say that you have built high end custom homes, but can't figure out if 48K is enough for demo? I'm just not following that. Doesn't make sense to me.

What happens if we encourage your figure and it turns out to be too low and you lose your shirt. What if it's too high and you lose the job because you took the advice of a bunch of strangers that don't know the first thing about your business. That, my friend, isn't the definition of brilliant.

I’ve had a couple of customers contact me asking about concrete basement wall surface blemish repair. Many newer homes in our area have poor quality surface on concrete basement walls with many pits, voids, cavities and scale. Though my bread and butter is basement finishing and renovation, they don’t want the possible in-wall moisture issues that can arise in, and behind wood studs, insulation and plastic building materials used when covering the concrete with drywall or paneling. 
I’ve never recommended concrete surface repair because my personal experience with any of those products eventually fail, losing surface adhesion. I’ve told them that the cost and hassle would eventually be much greater that simply walling it in. Some customers with special needs don’t want this though. They just want the natural concrete (without the imperfections) because of its strength and ability to wick moisture into the air without trapping it somewhere to start the mold process. 
Any ideas?Thoroseal - sponge the voids then use Tampico brush to achieve nice vertical striations"Under promise, over deliver and all that!" JBM

It has all the signs of going into foreclosure and I was wondering if anyone has had luck buying properties like this. 

Is it better to wait until it is bank owned or try to contact the owners and work out a short sale?

I did some snooping and talked to the neighbors, it's a messy divorce and the house has been vacant almost two years. 

The tax records show it is still in both their names. 

Sounds like the laundry room flooded, the heat pump is shot, a couple of windows are busted, the carpet is shot and I'm sure the UGS are toast.

It always seems someone is willing to pay more than they are worth for the condition they are in.Bills and behavior always come due.SBag....

I do a whole lot with flips and foreclosure aquizitions.... IN CO.

First.... You need to understand thoroughly your State's foreclosure laws...... each State is different.... you could pay an attorney an exhoribatant rate who may or may not comprehend the business aspects of foreclosure, or you might do better to check your publuic records and find someone active and proficient in the business to teach/proctor you for a much smaller sum.

As a GROSS GENERALITY, without knowledge of WA foreclosure, and in answer to your specific question and facts as delineated, I am very skeptical of your chance of aquizition thru short sale.

Evaluate the following:

1) Go to public records in your county and check title. ( They may be online in your county...I can tell you/estimate what every/any one in my county owes on their home in about two minutes) They are public records and see/estimate the extent of prior encumbrances on the property. I suspect it is underwater and encumbered by multiple interests. This means that it is almost certain it will go to foreclosure, as trying to resolve multiple party beuracratic and corporate and agency interests is almost impossible.

2) Considering the personal circumstances of vacancy and divorce, you can pretty well be certain that you will not get collaborative cooperation between both parties. Even if title is held in one name, you will not get cooperation wiyhout their interests being served... and they probably do not give a damn about their credit rating improvement with a short sale verse a foreclosure on their record.,, and additionally a normal servicer (bank in laymen's terms) has to prove "fair value? received which is a cumberson slow process.

3) Now with a good knowledge of your state's foreclosure law, there may be multiple opportunities to aquire the prop thru the foreclosure/redemption process by purchasinf a subordinate and small lien... can't say, don't know the property records nor WA law.

4) A bank purchase after foreclosure is basically a long drawn out procedure, with competeing interests, in most circumstances.

For every 10 people who believed the hype around favoraable aquization of distress properties, only 1-2 know what they are doing and are successful.

I've lost (let go) alot of properties to these first time, and only one time, players.

Good luck

Sab....

The department of Public Records/Real Estate/Grantee-Grantor Index/ Recording/Registry of Deeds/PublicRE Records/PubiicRecorders Office etc often goes by similar but different names.....

In my experience, the Tax Assesor and Treasurers Office are usually different departments..... Sometimes you have to go to the Assesors Records to get the owners name to subsequently search title which includes all encubrances/liens on the property... 

although the lien is on the property, it is filed (and created) under the owners name of record at the time it occurs. 

I'll bet that the internet will have alot of your local Foreclosure Info available.... Needless to say, it has been a hot topic over the past 6 -10 years.

Ha ha. No, you didn't read it right. That's what I think it looks like inside right now. 

So far, haven't been able to make contact with the owner.Bills and behavior always come due.I have done better on price with the foreclosure than on a short sale every time as both the homeowners and the bank are typically delusional when working out terms of a short sale if i am trying to buy it at a price point to flip and make a profit (and I am certain they say the same about me and since I depend on making a profit on the resale I am in fact trying to buy it for well under actual value so they may have a point). 

The foreclosure sale is only difficult because while the pricing is usually better there are going to be at least half a dozen bidders. It is better now than 6-7 years ago though - back then everybody and their brother with a savings account or line of credit thought they could buy and flip houses so the auctions were impossible and the sale prices were way over value often. After '08 and '09 enough people got burned that the amateurs have backed away in our area.

If you are looking for a source of properties to renovate and flip it is worth your time to go to the tax sales. The usually go for less than the foreclosures and the quit claim tax deed is easier to settle than the foreclosure deeds that are not signed off on by 1/3rd of the parties usually so end up in a mess for 6 months before any chance of selling it.Working means you get paid- If I am losing money on a job I am not working and I can't afford to take days off.Thanks RuebenD.

This house needs more work than most people will understand. It will be interesting to see what it goes for.Bills and behavior always come due.Just found out today that it is going to auction the first of the year. Anyone one have any experience with foreclosure auctions?Bills and behavior always come due.I recently bought a house on a short sale. 

The house was worth about $120. The occupants (owners) were into a bank for $200. The listing realtor got a good opinion on the price and the bank was willing to accept no less than $75 after commissions, costs, etc.

They agreed to give the occupants (owners) $3000 in WAM to leave the place empty and in good condition.

I think we closed in 3 weeks after they accepted my offer of $95 and there was a laundry list of things to get squared away on the abstract, all of which were taken care of.

I'd never heard of such a deal before. The bank takes a bath for so much money, and pays the person in the home to move out.

I'm just happy I'm on the other side of the deal.

Anyone involved in something like this, get your own realtor to deal with the listing realtor and let the professionals deal with everything. It is important that the listing agent be motivated to get the short sale done, and your realtor may have to be that motivation. A couple thousand $ in the deal for your realtor keeps them pushing to make sure the deal happens.cleveman said:

Yeah.. that was the unofficial "Cash for Keys" program. The loans are insured so the banks don't really lose anything unless they need some losses to write off. 

Part of the reason why the housing crisis became a crisis in the first place was because the banks were knowingly accepting bad loans. Then when the insurance companies couldn't keep up, they stopped insuring loans and the requirements for home ownership started to tighten up.I'm always looking for the answer to my troubles at the bottom of a paint can.cleveman said:

Cleve... 

I'd only comment that it's not an issue of right or wrong (probably should be in a perfect world and IMO), but it is just economic reality.

Depending on the State, eviction itself can be a lengthy/costly process. Furthermore, foreclosed parties often strip/vandalize a property.

An inducement / "cooperative stick" is often the best arrangement for all from a practical financial/profit standpoint. (Strange world of laws we live in...huh)

Sabag.... Each State has it's own forecloseure procedure, and "working the auction" to get a favorable price is a negotiation technique.

When foreclosure auctions are done among multiple properties, it is probably smart to show conviction to your desire to obtain the property .... ("I want it for my daughters house" in pre-auction chit chat.

When there are multiple properties and investors involved, they don't want to compete against "personal convicted " interests.... they will look to other offerings.

(I should caution you that direct collusion among buyers in many states is an act of fraud.... however, don't believe that it does not exist.)

In a single property auction, many states are done by an attorney at their own appointed time and place, there is not much you can do to work the auction that other pro's do not recognize.... BUT what you want to carefull of is the non-pros.... who overbid the property... don't compete with them... let them have it... know your limits.... there will be another opportunity around the corner.

Also, if you have smart FRIENDS very nearby to the property, regardless of whether multiple/single property auction, have them "down talk" the property (Oh yea.... I think they had alot of water damage and mold issue)

Most pro's, and even novices, try and talk with neighbors as in most states they have no access to the property....

Be aware ..... and don't fall in love.....

Be aware.... don't be buying work... that is plentifull... be buying opportunity.



And GOOD LUCK..... alot is luck.

I just can't imagine that you could straighten out a piece that's that warped. You will have to make you a new one and then you wont be able to adjust it like the factory piece, so you'll have to, by trial and error, keep shimming the new wooden strip until it's good. THEN... put in new screws to hold it down. But remember, use stainless screws, or they will rust out in now time and you'll be screwed.

I’ve run the screws down through the adjustable piece – thinking it would come out – but it appears to be locked in (in profile imagine two “Js” – one upside down that interlock). When I put the pry bar on it, I think the whole threshold will come with it (I don’t want that to happen).

I thought about “adjusting” the hinges to tilt the door a bit, but the reveals look really good – if not too tight already.

Now, I’m thinking about just taking my belt sander as close as I can to the jamb/stop, then using the multi tool to shave close to the jamb (where the belt sander can’t reach).

Not that I remember, no, but it's been a while since I had to mess with one, so I wouldn't bet either way.

The last time I had to mess with one was when I had a door going on a concrete slab and I had to remove the wood so I could drill the base to use anchors. In this case, the screws were new and it was easy peazy on that job. Older screws can give you a fit.I've had several of these replaced on new builds as they always seem to get scratched.

I believe this piece is composit (maybe PVC). The head would also suck through - before it sucked down.I love what I do and I'm very good at it!

Da Vinci on the web or Da Vinci On FacebookGood afternoon All,

We have a shower wall that has some glass installed. The concern that we have is the piece of glass is too long and therefore is flexing at the door hinge if someone leans on it.

Any suggestions on how to anchor it (maybe going to the ceiling?) without it looking terrible.

Thanks in advance

Is the hinge rocking and seeming like it might fail, or only the glass flexing? If the latter, add another hinge or two. Tough to do with the sleek look, but probably your best bet. If the hinge is rocking, you need some anchoring one way or another. Good luck. Nice house.BlueRidgeGreen said:

I would have the glass guy install a header before using a vertical support. Never had a problem with glass and the proper amount of stand offs, if they are mounted to wood blocking.It sounds like it is just the glass flexing if you push on it. Don't lean on it.

Adding another hinge after the fact is tough because the door panel is fabricated for the existing hinges. Also, adding another hinge adds a stress/pinch point if the hinges or wall aren't perfect. Good chance of it eventually exploding.By looking at the pic, I assumed he was having issues with the fixed panel.

Tiny door like that.....no way it needs three hinges (unless it's 1/8" glass).

As long as the two are secured.....it should be aces.

RRK.....I hate me some metal headers on my shower glass, which is why I use the CR Laurence stuff all the time. Like you said, with adequate blocking, I've never had an issue."Timid men prefer the calm of despotism to the tempestuous sea of liberty". Thomas JeffersonLooks like not much can be done with that. I've seen fixed panels that had a little play in them, just like that one.Expect the UnexpectedI did a very similar shower last year. The glass felt really solid after installation. I did install additional framing so the glass brackets would have something solid to bite into.

If you're having an issue with the blocking, you may be able to open up the wall from the other side: easier to repair drywall than it is to repair that tile.

Good luckJonSo long as there's solid blocking behind the hinges and mounts for the fixed piece, you've got what you ordered I bet. They are indeed glass panels...and they are frameless. They're not something made to be 'leaned on' or pulled against...they're GLASS. You want the look of frameless, you'd better treat it as such! That being said, I like the look.www.stratmanconstruction.com
Like us on Facebook!My normal install is 3/8 glass with two hinges. Never a problem unless the builder doesn't add blocking.

My biggest problem is that CRL only packs 1 1/2 screws. 1/2 inch tile and grout with 1/2 inch rock/Hardie backer doesn't give much to grab. I always add 2-2 1/2 inch screws.Nothing add except that's a nice a$$$ shower!that is a beautiful shower. I might have to copy yours when I do my own.i bought a new truck and with my racks on it wont fit in my garage any more. the racks are system one aluminum racks. i thought about cutting the legs of the racks down a few inches which would be easy to do.
or i thought about raising the door height about three inches. it is not load bearing so cutting it higher would not be a problem. i would just have to remove some siding and re do the jambs and such.

if i could add a three inch piece to the top of my garage door to make up for the difference. i don't know what i would use to add the three inches to the top of the door. it is a metal insulated door.
i thought if i could buy another panel and rip it down to three inches and just attach it to the top panel maybe that could work.

i know i will probably have to move the track up also

any ideas would be appreciated

Your opening is probably 7' tall, go to 8' and change the entire door if you have the head room.

TomYou answered the question yourself... cut the legs of the racks a few inches... easy to do...

The other way involves more work, and more money, and a most likely goofy looking result with the 3" add-on to the door..tjbnwi said:

I said just because it's a gable wall doesn't mean that it isn't load bearing. I didn't say that it was or always is load bearing. Trusses also don't mean that it's not load bearing either, but it is obvious that you checked what kind of gable truss was used.

My point was educational. Many look at these threads and they are also searchable on Google. Just wanted to make sure that it was known that a gable wall can be load bearing and that it shouldn't just be assumed that it isn't.Tried & True on Facebook

Go to an 8' door. By the time you get done fiddle farting around you could just do it right.

It is rare to see a gable truss made to clear span as they are just on stud layout and are full load bearing.I am still trying to figure out why you would go through the added expense and hassle of doing this as opposed to cutting the legs of the rack a few inches... :blink:

There'd have to be a substantial benefit to go through the expense and hassle of raising the door height as opposed to lopping off a couple inches off the rack IMHO...

griz
i know what you are saying about gable trusses being studded in that case they do not bear much load but in this case when i built the garage all the trusses are attic type that span 30'.
i just used the same trusses for the gables and studded them in.

i know what you are saying about fiddle farting around and i am usually one to do things right but for a few inches i was trying to see if any one had any magic idea.

the truck with the racks will actually fit if i was on the level but i come up a slight grade and right when i back in the very rear end of the rack would hit the opening. after i pass a certain point i am good.
ill have to check if i can pull in instead of back in. it might make a difference

thanks...................nicko"Quality work for those who know the difference"When I bought my old house, it had a garage with a seven foot door. If I had to work on my van, I would have to let air out of the tires to get it inside. Thankfully my new garage I built and put in a nine foot door. This was the maximum I could have due to height restrictions on garages in my town. Any higher and my roof pitch would have been lower than I wanted due to the snow we get here in Muskoka. If you have the head room above the door, I would get another full panel if you could match it. Otherwise, tear that one out, sell it and buy another one. Chalk it up to experience and don't build another garage with a seven ft door. I think they should be outlawed. Nothing more than a small vehicle will fit it the darn things. For sure someone in the future will be cursing just like you are. I would have went twelve feet if they would have let me.I don't think backing in will make a difference in this case. are these measurements with the truck loaded down-if so, it will ride a tiny bit higher when the load/gas tank isn't full. 

If you have racks, won't you occasionally put something up there? I sure would hate to forget and pull in rip something off.I think garage door panels are sized in 3" increments. So just get one new panel for each side if you need to raise it up a few. If you have the clearance, and feel like spending the money, you'll be much better of with 8' doors.I vote for adding another vertical foot to the opening. That way, you can clear both your rack and some extra material that you might have left on your rack and forgotten about. (I may have once tried to drive in my garage with a kayak on top of my SUV. In case anyone is wondering, the kayak won that battle!)ok. here is what i did
the racks are system one so the legs are aluminum extrusions. I took one leg off at a time ( i had the racks off) and cut two inches off of them and put them back on.
then i removed all the aluminum coverage off of my garage door frame and had a 2x10 header over the door, but like i said the wall is a gable end with a load bearing truss so i didn't really need that big of a header if any. I removed a total of two inches from the header. I had a 2x6 on the flat under the header so i just removed that and cut a half inch off the header. That made my door height two inches taller.

I removed some siding and and re-did the trim on the top of the door and then recovered every thing with aluminum and installed new rubber garage door sill around the opening.

then to add two inches to the top of the door i used a piece of azek ripped to two inches and screwed it to the top of the top panel
the garage door is white wood grain so i put the wood grain of the azek facing out. The azek is flush with the face of the door and when the door is shut you can only see about one inch of the azek because of the rubber seal.

it took me about 6 hours yesterday and about six hours today that included putting the racks and tool boxes on the new truck and reloading the boxes and truck. With a total cost of about $75.00

I now have three inches to spare. As for as having things on the racks when i pull in, being that they are system one racks, wher the lumber lays is five inches lower than the top of the racks so that gives me a total of about eight inches before they would hit.

whenever it comes time to get a new door i will get one to fit the opening

I'm sure there are more but I have an unhappy Grandson that I'm riding herd on.Hey guys,

I'm closing in a porch in a part of town that has notoriously bad hack jobs for houses. The porch sits in a corner between two different renos done previously on the house:










Tore out the old concrete, which was two different slabs one poured over the other varying in thickness between 1" - 3" and pitched towards the house. Found air pockets between the bottom of the slab and the dirt some 3", some less. Assumed that water from the back yard, which is pitched towards the house, washed out the dirt and caused the slabs to crack. 

Leveled and compacted dirt. Poured a new slab 5-8" thick sloped away form the house. 

Noticed brick wall holding up the left side was in poor condition and letting water in:




















So I wrapped it in metal lath and had a stucco guy stucco it. Had him put a 1" slope on top away from the porch. 

Framed walls, 1/2 osb decking, wrapped in tyvec, flashed where the wall met the stucco and sided it in hardie. 

Is any of this overkill?

Some ahole was walking around the job telling the HO that everything I was doing was overkill and telling her how he could save her all this money, and she was agreeing!

I was also planning on putting in a foundation drain across the back side of the house along with some drylock waterproofing, but now I'm thinking about saying screw it, let the water rot your house away.

But , I'm also a young dude and really don't know that much, so maybe I am wasting her money? 

I should note that this is a T&M job with no estimate or ball park figure given or asked for.Always do the best job possible. Never take the cheap and easy route, it cost more in the long run.

It would have been best to rip that thing down and start new.

Yep, that's what I should have done. In fact the whole house should really come down. Half of the houses floor joists are sitting on dirt. 

The slab in the pic is the one I poured. The old one was cracked to hell. Looked worse then the brick. 

The guy telling her it's overkill was a 50something year old handyman. He came in to caulk the tub and "fix" a rotten window sill. 

His "fix" for the sill was to take a piece of hardie scrap from my pile and caulk it on top of the rotten sill...

He was telling her that he does things right but "creatively" to save her money...Ahhhh "Caulk Man" even better. Fixin' the world's problems one squeeze at a time.

I'm not sure she's getting steak, maybe just a burger that isn't from the dollar menu.

Just for the hell of it here's an interesting crown job in her kitchen:What are your thoughts on taking on this project?

Good previous client, new home (4 yr old construction). They would like to modify their master shower without affecting the tilework (i.e. working from behind each side wall). Shower is 4' wide alcove, 9' ceiling with one recessed light, double shower heads (L,R), each with its own Moen valve (L,R). Wall tile ends a couple inches above the showerheads, (which would be removed...then filled or plated or something...) 

They would like to convert this to a rainshower (centered at 24") + a handheld shower mounted somewhere.

I'm thinking about lowering the ceiling in the alcove, piping into that from one valve, splitting the light into two, etc. Other valve can run to a newly located handheld, or maybe we would just replace the head with something nicer, like a shower bar.

Does that sound like a plan worth advancing, or more of a headache than anything? Everything is so darned clean and perfect in this house already. It's several miles further than I like to travel, as well.

Edit: I just realized this would likely mean replacing the valves to match new stuff..not so hard on the left (closet), moreso on the right since the wall angles away from the shower and runs into the adjacent outer wall less than 2'. This wall is over the soaking tub. I'll have to think about this even more carefully.Lowering the ceiling may make it look a little clunky.Whats above this bath? A second floor?

Attic above. But I think it might look odd to use the entire 9' height for this thing (arm & head). Haven't seem too many of these, and none with a 9' ceiling.I'm hoping someone can advise on the following: So I've been tasked with covering a detached garage with horizontal vinyl siding. In researching this and talking with a few people I've received just about every answer possible. I am planning to strap the wall with 1x3 lumber and fasten with tapcons. On the advise of a several people I purchased non-treated lumber, which I wondered at the time if it is a mistake. I realize this is normally used for strapping sheathing, but against concrete is it asking for rot? It was suggested that I show put a strip of tyvek between the wood and concrete to prevent wicking into the wood. As far as I know Tyvek will not "wick" moisture, but is not a vapor barrier either. Would 6mil Poly or tar paper be more appropriate? I'm considering giving the backs of the strapping a quick coat of green preservative before the go up. Lastly, are there any thoughts on putting additional weather barrier on top of the strapping, which isn't usually done?

Any thoughts are appreciated!I would have suggested PT but it is what it is now and it is only a garage.

No vapor barrier, just my opinions of course.

Now, who the hell are you and why didn't you post an introduction?

Just giving you a hard time.

It's like being in the field ain't it?

Andy.https://andytardif.wixsite.com/websiteI would hope you are covering the strapping.
I have used strapping on concrete with no problems. Just don't start at ground level.Putting vinyl siding just over strapping, I can see that not holding up over the long haul. 

I have done something like this before with a block house. Used 1x4 strapping with ridge foam board in between, then was covered with steel siding. Liquid nailed and screwed wood to the blocks. Still looks good 20 years later.Randy Bush said:

I was going to say, use some construction adhesive to add another means of connection in case any of the anchors loosen up over time.

Then again, i cant imagine liquid nails holding up longer than tapcons, if they snug up when driven.

Unless you do the siding, flashing and trim all wrong, and the garage is over a marsh, i imagine non treated furring will last a long time. But sounds like youre very concerned, so why didnt you get PT?

By the time the wood starts rotting and the tapcons lose their grip, that vinyl will be in a landfill in exchange for another style or color of that decade.thanks for the replies

Thanks all for the replies! Sorry for not introducing myself. I do small to medium renovations, working out of southwestern Ontario, Canada. I've only been running my own business for 3 years now, but have worked for a friend for about 7 years before this. Its good to hear from people who've been doing these things much longer than me!

Should have mentioned that as was pointed out I'd be putting foam in between the strapping for support. Since no one carries PT strapping nearby I'd probably have to rip my own (easy, but extra work). It seems like the consensus though is just screw them directly to the blocks, maybe a bit of adhesive, and probably put some breathable housewrap between the strapping and vinyl. Wicking in the block is probably minimal since it is all above ground and the vinyl lets a lot of air around it. Probably you are right that it is overthinking since the vinyl will probably be gone before the wood rots and if I go PT, the tapcons will probably rust out before the wood rots.I think tapconing the strapping is overkill and time consuming. We usually use glue and nails to do this. Either hand nail with masonry nails or if there is a lot to do we get hardened nails for our framing nailer and shoot them on. You are not holding a lot of weight with vinyl siding.personally i would sheath over the furring first and eliminate the foam before installing vinyl,but thats just meTomTom Struble said:

Click to expand...

Is this because of wind behind the vinyl? If it's not I'm clueless as to why and also really curious about the desire for sheathing which in my mind is just more weight.We use pt 2x4 sleepers with pl premium and a few tapcons. If the inside of the structure is conditioned we will fill in between the sleepers with 1.5" rigid insulation. The rigid doesnt do much but something is better than nothing.I have a friend asking me about adding some attic insulation to his vacation home that is manufactured.

This home has a 2x4 framed attic trusses , shingled roof with 4/12 pitch. 14' X 70 ' home. The interior ceilings are NOT vaulted and are flat. There appears to be R19 laying on the ceiling, but it has gaps and such and could use some improvement. 

Access/venting is at the front and back gables only. There is a ridge vent on the home. No fascia venting.

Questions:

If blown-in is added, it will touch the roof underlayment near the roof/wall connection. Is that ok? (It can be blown in through the gable assess and possibly some interior access openings).

Will venting of the space be sufficient with just the 2 14" X 14" gable vents an ridge vent, or should turbines be added?

How can you control insulation from being near/covering areas like furnace chimney, etc?

How much do you think should/could be added?

Thanks much, ToddFirst off, the venting is screwy. Gable vents in conjunction with a ridge vent means that a good portion of the venting gets short-circuited and doesn't really do its job. The better way is vented soffit feeding air upward along the underside of the roof sheathing to the ridge vent, and no gable vents at all.

As for controlling where the blown insulation lands, that's not all that difficult. Similar to spraying water with a garden hose, you can be pretty precise in most cases. For the exceptions, just wade in and scoop it away from the areas you don't want covered.I'm not so sure if fascia vents could be added. Not much, is any overhang. I will take a look again at it.

Thanks for the feedback.
ToddAll I can say is that weatherization crews blow the cavities full with cellulose or fiberglass and don't worry about the venting - as for long term results...SLS Construction & Building Solutions LLC Our Blog - The HTRCStaple up baffles where insulation might contact the roof deck, or make your ownI wish I could put up baffles, but there is no space to get down in there to do that. I suppose I could just position them down.

I am going to look closer at this job next week.What difference does the baffle make if it's not pulling air from the eave (or lack of eave)?-JohnManufactured homes roofs are just asking for problems, low pitch, poor insulation, no vents, no eaves soffit, means warm roof that melts snow here in MI, massive ice damming accurs. I worked on one that was around 20 years old, water ran off roof, down the face with no overhang, icicles all the way down frozen right on the vinyl, gets behind the siding, runs down horizontally, and rots the wall out. Ive seen this in multiple double wide homes. If It were mine and i was forced to live in it, id be tempted to blow the small attic cavity full with cellulose, and install a metal roof with a few inches of actual overhang.Actually, I think he was considering a metal roof....but down the road.

The home is actually a really nicely constructed home, but yes, the roof assembly could be improved upon.


Here's his plan. Tell me what you think.

1. Blow cellulose into the attic from both gable vents and interior access as best as possible. Trying to not pack it in too tightly at the sidewall/roof connection.

2. Increase the size of the front gable/rear gable vent as much as possible.

3. Install 2 spinner turbines, or additional venting in the roof. (Maybe 4 or 5 vents, vs 2 spinners. (This is in addition to the ridge vent).

4. Do you guys prefer cellulose, or fiberglass?
and....would it be bad if at the wall/roof connection, the insulation touches the roof underlayment?

Thanks again.....Installing spinners isnt going to do much if anything, neither will all the extra vents. Theres NO eves overhang so allowing a baffle gap isnt going to do anything. If there is still a cavity left after you get done blowing insulation, then yes, your current gable or ridge vents will help some.
You probably have 4 luvered vents as well on mfc homes. You have enough vents, problem is is that air cant travel from eaves soffits because there arn't any. 
Best solution is to keep heat loss to a minimum to start with.i was looking at a job today for someone that wants to make a room for an office. The space is under a garage that is part of the house. The ceiling is concrete panels that lay over a steel beam in the center and on the foundation walls on the perimeter. 
The ceiling height is about 7' 7" and they want a suspended ceiling so i would end up with a 7' ceiling height. Code would be r-38 in my area and there is no way i can get 12" of bat insulation in that 7" space. I am never going to get it up to code and it is not going to be inspected. ( Hold the hack comments!!!) It is a small room for a friend of mine. 

I was thinking of using two layers of two inch extruded polystyrene foam attached to the concrete.
any other ideas would be appreciated

thanks...............Nicko"Quality work for those who know the difference"Put an air gap between foam & concrete & the two pieces of foam.

Find a high R-value ceiling tile also.I may be wrong in my thinking on this but it sounds like a basement situation, so you may not need the insulation or that much of it ( r38 ) ?

If it was me and for a buddy Id adhere 2" foam or have it sprayed and be done. Think of how a thin coffee cup keeps you from burning even when you pour screening hot coffee in it. I know basement in eastern KS unheated or insulated don't get colder then 55 in dead of winter but i dont know about where your at. So as i said if its underfround you may not really need as muchRed Adobe
You are right about the basement situation. It is the attic space that requires r 38. I think basement ceilings are r-19 if the basement is heated. But this being under an un heated garage with the garage floor being the basement ceiling I don't know what that would fall under. 
Nicko"Quality work for those who know the difference"Do not use fiberglass at all. It does not play well up against concrete. Dow or spray foam. Spray foam would be the method I would push. The high density foam creates its own vapor barrier at 1-1/2". Are you sure the garage floor doesn't leak? Just might wanna make sure before investing money underneath it.It is what it is...now fix it.:whistlingHow are you planning on attaching it? 3" of poly iso will give you R-21. Most people have a condensation problem with such a slab, so you'll have to get it around the beam area somehow as well.cleveman said:

i never thought about a condensation problem. i guess if i add heat to the room there is that potential. i would hate to do the job and then have a condensation problem. i am not sure how i would tell if that would be an issue. If i installed the foam with the seams all tight and off set the seams on the second layer of foam from the first and foil tape all the seams could that reduce the chance for condensation problems?
Also there is no one in my area that does spray foam i checked into it for another job a while back and they could only spray about 1 1/2" thick for some reason
thanks...............nicko"Quality work for those who know the difference"There are people on the forum who know much more about this than I do. I was thinking of the condensation problem in the summer, not the winter. The foam will stop the condensation anyway.

I still would like to hear how you will attach the foam.

Tongue and groove and staggering the joints with two layers is a good idea, but you'll need twice as many fasterners.cleveman said:

I thought about maybe using treated 1x for furring and tap con that to the concrete and then attach my first layer of foam with roofing nails then install my second layer and screw through both layers with long grk rss screws with fender washers. 

That's alot of overhead concrete drilling but I would do it. 
I'm sure I could come up with a better way if I gave it more thought. 
But I am open for any suggestions

Thanks..........nicko"Quality work for those who know the difference"Are you sure the slab above the space is poured the in place vs. pre-tensioned? If it's pre-tensioned you don't want to start drilling all over in it.It is what it is...now fix it.:whistlingYour best bet is closed cell spray foam sprayed directly against the concrete - fiberglass, cellulose & open cell is just asking for trouble. 

Foam board - an air gap only works if you have an area to vent it to / drain any water that may get in there. That is also the catch with trying to adhere it to the concrete as it will never be perfectly adhered allowing moisture to just sit. 

Fortunately though this may not be to big of an issue with the garage overhead. You could always spray some adhesive against the concrete & hold the panels in place until they stick, tape the seams, do the next course (staggered seams) and then instead of going with a dropped ceiling, frame one up against the foam (giving you room to run a light, etc...)

To battle condensation, watch the interior humidity levels and don't use something stupid like using a vent less heater in their. I think the bigger issue is bulk water and it soaking in from above. 

Now how about them walls?SLS Construction & Building Solutions LLC Our Blog - The HTRChere is some pics of the ceiling. sorry they are sideways i don't know how to make them right. as you can see the concrete panels have ribs, so i guess it will have its own built in air space if i attach the foam to the ribs

Nicko"Quality work for those who know the difference"Those are concrete plank, with a topping of concrete over for the garage floor. Many apartments, condo's etch where built using them. If your not heating it, why worry about insult? For sound barrier? I'd spray foam and forget about it.Have a customer with a 1970's 4 pane bay window. Fogging in the one pane. I took the pane out and cleaned the seat for the new glass. Got a single strength insulated pane 21" x 55 3/4". Went to replace it today. Dry fitted the glass then removed it and used silicone caulk around the seat. Placed the bottom of the glass in the seat and slowly guided it into place. Was about halfway home and the glass broke halfway up and straight across the outside pane. .......... removed the pane, scraped out the caulking bed and put plastic over the opening. What went wrong? Suggestions?How tight was the fit?

Did you use a suction cup?

The pane may have had a small nick in the edge that you couldn't see.Trump-The "Con Man's" Con Man.pane was not tight. Left 1/8" for expansion when I had it made up. Grabed the window on both sides no suction cup. Was kinda thinking maybe a defect I didnt see on the edge where it was cut?That is pretty big for a single strength pane if you don't work with glass. Most likely you tapped the edge on the frame. It only takes a small chip to cause it to break. Another thing is that the frame may be tweaked and you pushed it to set it and it caused a weak spot to pop.

Are the other ones siliconed in? If they are taped, go to a glass shop and get a short length of weather tape. It helps add a bit of cushion of the frame is beat up.

When I have popped one, it is usually because I missed a small chunk of glass.VinylHanger said:

Reordered another glass this time in double strength. Went over the frame really good and made sure it was smooth. plenty of room to set it in. I allowed 1/8" all the way around the pane. Good suggestion about the weather tape... Thanks... :thumbup:Just an update. Put the glass in the other day and it went flawless. I think maybe there must have been a small defect in the first pane.

Number 2 will exceed the countertop overhangI do between 1 - 3 DWs a week, and whenever possible I make the main plane of the door flush with the cabinet doors/drawers. Sometimes it's not possible though. There is an ideal, which your pic #1 is, and then there's what happens in the real world when your swapping a dishwasher in an existing house. I've had several times that I've had to use a small saw and take material out above the DW because even with the DW as low as it would go, and even though I just took a DW out of the hole, the new DW won't go in.#1 is better, but sometimes you will have a dishwasher with controls on the top and a big counter overhang and #2 will be preferred by the customer. Had it happen once before.The install really depends on the dishwasher. I wouldn't even try to answer this question without pictures of the top of the door. Why? Because several models have the controls on top of the door instead of on the face.I prefer #1 but I've had issues with clearance at the top and/or sides or I didn't have anything to screw the DW to underside of the countertop and had no choice but to bring them out further.Flush with the cabinets, but the countertop must cover the handle.pic number one for sureSo it is safe to say ''Depends''. :whistlingExpect the UnexpectedIf you have a quartz or marble top, you will have to set the dishwasher so the side clips line up with the frame of the cabinet.
Some of the dishwashers have plastic strips on the sides, that get screws through them. Those also have to be lined up with the frame of the cabinet. Even if screws don't go through the plastic strips, they are put in for sound dampening. This may determine how far back it has to be pushed.Thanks for the feedback. Dishes are washing, check is cashed and spent.
Went with #1. I was in a hurry to get it dialed in before the slab arrived, way easier that way. Also had to snake plumbing through toekick, pita!

The DW was a Bloomberg, poor man's bosch. Very nice machine! One of the side strips had a kink, and they 2 day FedEx 'ed me a new one...so I like this company. 
Front controls, but all the top controls I have seen don't need access when closed. (press setting and start, the close door.)

Has anyone direct drained a Dw in a residential? Seems like it would be the way to go if I had to do this again."faster horses, younger women, older whiskey, and more money"I've had to drop through a floor and catch the drain from the kitchen sink before. Put a p trap into a y and put a barb fitting on the p trap.Ideally, push it back until it is flush with the drawer/door fronts. With top controls, it needs to be far enough out so that the controls are accessible with the countertop in place. That will vary a bit. Coordinate with your subs.I have done hundreds of DW when I was an installer for Blowes. #1 is the proper way IMO. On good days I could easily install 5, but had 1 that took 5 hours, when you're day is scheduled tight it is a HUGE PITA to call everyone to reschedule because the old lady that was first in the morning had a really old house, with all custom built kitchen that was over 100 years old. Old enough that there were no standard heights for counters, it was 32" tall not normal 36". Had to cut framing, legs off and really mess around to get it to fit.

In the end, got it and I won but dang it was horrible!

BTW, don't you just love the old shut offs that leak the moment you touch then? Got a supply of most sizes and shapes in trailer just in case.I know I'm crazy...I love concreteIf the controls are on the top of the door I still like it flush with drawers. What I found on most models is that you can turn it on with the door open select settings you want and the water won't start till you close the door. So it not always needing to stand out if controls up on topGot about 2500 sq ft of suspended ceiling to hang was wondering if any one has ever used zip ties instead of tie wire? Just thinking it might be faster.No way. Even if you trust the zip ties, what happens when you draw one a tad too tight and need to let it out some?Nylon and plastic has a life expectancy and over time will become brittle. Even kept out of sunlight. I've seen large coax cable hung by zip ties and over time if the zip tie was holding the weight of the cable it would start to break one by one. I wouldn't trust the zip ties over wire even if it is quicker.Don't do it.hdavis said:

I noticed there are many others out there that are also flipping/ remodeling homes so wanted to share some products we use that save us lots of time in our remodels. 

First is a product sold on homedepot.com called EZ-DOOR. This product updates existing flat doors and gives them the look of a 2-panel door with an arch at the top. The set comes with frames, template, adhesive and caulk. Quick and easy since the template replaces the need to measure. Tremendous bang for the buck.

Second product is sold in-store at Home Depot called Hubbell TayMac decorator wall plate. This product fits right over existing outlets and updates to the Decora style outlets without any rewiring needed.

My husband is a contractor and employs a crew for remodels and flips alike. There are many factors that were considered in the use of the EZ-DOOR product. Among the considerations was quality of the finished product, environment, customer’s budget and noise. 
Quality - Ninety percent of the people who see the finished doors, in our presence, believe the doors have been replaced. Environment - Typically, old doors end up in the dump adding to an already substantial problem. 
Customer budget -Not all customers have the budget to have doors replaced. This product allows us to offer those customers a solution rather than simply turning them away. 
Noise - Some of the properties we remodel or flip are condos. Using saws, drills, routers, etc. isn’t always well received by the neighbors. This product eliminates the noise created from traditional door replacement. 
Profit margins are increased due to the simplicity of installation and the ability to have a lesser skilled (lower cost) employee do the door upgrades. In addition, our painting contractor has started offering the product as a way to expand his revenue stream on standard painting jobs. 
I agree, this is not for everyone or every property, but it is a viable alternative.I think the products are crap, but it was more the way you popped in and that was the first thing you posted.

We are all professionals, and as such most of us have mad skills. Unless I am forced to use diy products, I stay way away from them. I am sure most do as well.

Those types of fake products are a good way to get a bad reputation. I have had some frugal customers, but even they don't want to go the HD faux product route.Mthomas2898 said:

Customer budget -Not all customers have the budget to have doors replaced. This product allows us to offer those customers a solution rather than simply turning them away.
Noise - Some of the properties we remodel or flip are condos. Using saws, drills, routers, etc. isn&#146;t always well received by the neighbors. This product eliminates the noise created from traditional door replacement.
Profit margins are increased due to the simplicity of installation and the ability to have a lesser skilled (lower cost) employee do the door upgrades. In addition, our painting contractor has started offering the product as a way to expand his revenue stream on standard painting jobs.
I agree, this is not for everyone or every property, but it is a viable alternative.

What problem is there with throwing it away? Oh, you believe that the land fills are filling up and that we are running it of space. Did you know that's not true nor is it an actual problem.

But I do agree that repurposing our reusing us always a good idea.

As for noise that is just silly. I have never had a complaint on noise abd if you did who cares. You have the right to work on your property as long as It's during construction hours. Who uses a router to install a door? Interior doors come off with a claw and hammer.

Click to expand...For those of you who have built your own solid wood doors to meet fire ratings, or bought the plain slab ones, applying molding is about the only way to dress them up and give them some style.

I've never tried to dress up a hollow core interior door. Most I've seen are a little beat, and getting another paneled one is pretty cheap and easy. Still not as easy as gluing some molding on the existing, I guess.

Do any repairs and sand the door smooth, put on the molding, paint. I'm on the fence with this one under the best of circumstances, but you're limited in the style you can do.

The outlet plates I'd definitely skip for the reasons given.I have a gable end bay section where the joists have to be flush mounted on both sides to a rim and girder that run 30 degrees skewed from the joist.

I know I can get 45 hangers, maybe 22.5, but what do you do when dealing with 30 degrees?

There's no space for a ledger board unless I notch the joists and the skew 45 hangers I've seen don't like like they would bend much to fit my angles.

Any other acceptable solutions?This?Yep, I'll probably have to go with thatThis may be more like what you are looking for?

I picked up some of these. In the areas where I have more depth under the full joists I'm going to add a ledger too just for the hell of it. ThanksI'm wrapping up a job and need about 20' of a certain moulding used as crown. I thought is was a rake of some sort, but nope. Been to a couple lumber yards and even woodcraft.

 If it's under 500 lf they charge a $25 set up fee per profile.I always get random lengths and add 10% overage.They charge a premium for specific lengths.
It's 20 miles from my shop and still worth it.Same here, just had 6 - 8 ft's I picked up today to finish up a couple bathrooms. They have hundreds of online profiles and charge $25 set up. There are 3 major mill work places around. I have always found who made the profile. I got a price of $10 ft from a place that was going to custom make it, for paint grade 3 1/2 casing.:laughing:Glad I don't live in MA or one of those historic states up north.I just got 4 1/4" custom base and 3 3/4" casing out of red oak for a little above $3 lf.mako1 said:

Another was going to charge $10 ft and have the knife made.a local guy around here has all the knives from the trim around here. over the years of him doing the trimwork he has run into most of it and has he knives. problem is he isnt always running trim so he is pretty expensive. seems like its about $400- $500 for anything from 8'-100'.

Not this time. The last time I got a quote like that, it was cost and time prohibitive. They always want to make a knife profile and charge an arm and a leg for it. 

It's a double room with a lot going on, pillar wraps, etc. I'm going to "borrow" from a hallway, and change that out instead.

I've looked all over the frame and doors themselves for some type of badge or manufacturer marking but had no luck, the only thing I could find is a "Guardian" etching on the glass. I took some pictures of the handle hoping that someone may recognize it and could tell me who makes this door. Also, Window-Rama had asked me for the interior glass dimensions when they were trying to help me before they threw the towel in, but in case that helps anyone,the glass is 27" wide x 75" high. Lastly, the house was built in 1992. If there is any additional info you may need to identify it please let me know and I will do my best to obtain it. Thanks.Rob Pennachio

http://www.metalarchitecture.com/articles/magazine-features/cure-and-conservation.aspxHi all ... pretty new to the forum here but I do maintenance for a retreat facility and have a question on how to decrease the amount of sound coming into the various retreat rooms.

The problem is that the main floor of the building is an older pre-fab home that was set on a walkout basement foundation. The "studs" are 2x3s and in some cases 2x2s. Definitely not enough to hand solid core doors on. The doors that are in place at the moment are hollow core with about an inch (in some cases slightly more) gap at bottom. 

I know that mass and seals are key sound prevention but I'm not sure how much more weight I can add and installing a new hollow core that closes the gaps better only helps slightly.

Is there anything you can suggest short of completely re-doing some of the framing to accomodate solid core doors?Do the walls have any insulation in them? Fiberglass hardly does anything but it's better than nothing. If you can, fill the wall cavities with cellulose, denim insulation, or mineral/rock wool. You could probably blow in cellulose and patch the holes without tearing out all the drywall.

There should be lighter, foam core or similar doors that would do better than the true hollow core. 

I assume you're not looking to do any major remodeling, so getting tighter fitting doors with gaskets and a lightweight fill should do some good.Most walls do not have insulation in them ... I didn't realize they made foam core doors. I will look into that. ThanksRoxul safe and sound is my vote. I put them in bathrooms and bedrooms- the only sound you can hear is through the doors themselves- otherwise you don't hear toilets flushing, fans, or water hitting the bath tub.Working on my BILs place and trying to get him to make a decision.

The original window frames are too rotten to use pocket/remodel sashes, and they're also nearly buried in the outer most layer of aluminum lap siding. I'm planning to use standard vinyl single or double hung windows.

If I'm not going to be able to salvage the existing frames, does that limit me to "new construction" windows with fins and cut back the aluminum; add trim?You can still use standard block frames. You will just need to flash it and seal it well. How you trim it, well that is up to you, aluminum wrap may be the best way.Cool, lets put some fabric over a window and let a hurricane throw some stuff at it.

I guess cutting back the aluminum, to allow for the nailing flange, and then covering that with trim and j channel, tucked under the cut edges of the AL siding, would be best. Aluminum wrap would be the way to go if I can rent a brake.You can definitely go that route too.

When I finally peeled off the plastic at the end of the job, the carpet was spotless. (it was a navy blue carpet too, so any debris would have really stood out. )

For hardwood floors, I just use either red rosin paper, or cardboard. I dont want anything reusable. It's going to get muddy, covered in gobs of spackle, sawdust and spackle dust, so I just want to throw it all out at the end of the job. I figure it as part of my operating costs.- Alex :thumbsup:

Indianapolis Kitchen Remodeling Contractor - Master of the Home FeatureI've seen drywall used a few times. Normally only because it was leftover scraps and not bought specially. Masonite is what a lot of the old-timers use. Over the door casings too.The guy made a million zillion dollars off of drop clothes over the years and when I see my painters not using one I remind them of that, I also tell them by not using one is a disrespect to the drop cloth guys personal intelligence and he would smack them in the head with a rolling pole if he heard them say we don't need one right now.

I like the pieces of drywall on the floor trick but everything has its place, I see drywall being good in a house where you are removing plaster and or doing heavy trim work.:clap::clap::clap:Commercial Painter KY. Residential Painter Louisville Painting Photos Louisvilleirockwithdirt said:

Try your local appliance salesman. Unless they're serious about recycling they should have refigerator boxes. Thy are pretty heavy duty and large enough to cover a good sized area.When you rob Peter to pay Paul, chances are pretty good you will receive Paul's vote. Apparently the object of the game is to create more Pauls than Peters....What happens when the Peters can no longer support the Pauls? .I like the 1/8" masonite. Only about $6/sheet. Reusable, light, and tough.First of all let me say I am new to this forum and hello to everyone. I just did a bathroom remodel and the client was very pleased, iv done a number of tile showers but the time in between is pretty long and I cant remember how I handled certain problems. The problem is this....when I install the Hardiback I run it out the shower to the next stud and this creates a but joint to the drywall all the way up the wall. Now trying to float the wall flat again is almost imposible especially when your only about 10" to the shower wall.{ in my area you cant have drywall inside the shower} so im left with a bit of a crown where the drywall and Hardiback meet after taping, topping and skimming, any ideas how I can avoid this issue without having to float the entire wall outside the shower or atleast half of it? Thank you.Put a stud where you tile ends and put your seam there.Tile out to the corner or just tile over the joint.That was the first thing I thought of but thought I would have issues with the Hardiback not being a true 1/2" in thicknessbut I guess if I do that and mesh the joint float the shower side with thinset and bring the tile a little past the joint I would be fine....thanks for the input.When I do bath tile I always pre-plan and frame it out. All my rock to backer transitions are double 2X's, glued and screwed together.66 Shelby said:

That's what I do and I double up the studs for shower doors/glass. I bring the tile to the corner or just go past the drywall transition. Either way the transition is outside the shower. I mesh the transition but I don't apply thinset so I don't have the crown.We use USG Fiberock instead of 1/2" hardi, as the Fiberock is a true 1/2" that meets well with drywall with no hump. We also put the seam in line with the outside of the curb and then run bullnose in front of the curb.Thanks Grizz...where can I find this USG Fiberock?We get it from our local tile supplier. Not sure about your area. Some of the big boxes carry it. Also, make absolutely sure you red guard or something comparable before tiling, as Fiberock is gypsum based. It would probably be ok without it, but you can never be too careful.Could use Durock which is full1/2" . I like to run the Durock abut past shower door and let the plaster's plaster over the seam.If the Hardi is not a full 1/2", there's this really cool thing called a shim. It looks just like a piece of wood.

If you are in the Antarctica and there is none of these wooden shims, then take felt paper and fold it over several times until it creates the needed thickness.

It's not brain surgery.

Edit: The felt would go behind the Hardi, and if you needed to know this, then you don't need to be in this business.It's called work smarter not harder. Why do all the work of shimming every single stud when you can just buy a different product that is actually less expensive than Hardi?Actually the thickness difference doesn't really have much to do with it, but joints are just harder to get flat because they don't have the inset that the seems in drywall does, now that I think about it, its the proximity of the but joint to the inside shower wall so adding a stud and putting the joint where ya need it so you can bring the tile out past it is the ticket. And yes sometimes we (meaning me) uverlook the abvious, but in this case don't think a shim is the obvious...yeah I know...I need to work on my spelling.TheGrizz said:

Hey... it's like everything else in the building industry. Sometimes, just exploring makes for the best teacher. The more you do, the more you learn how to prepare for the FUTURE situations that you're going to create. It's funny, but since the first time I posted in this thread I've run across the same thing... almost.

The house I'm in was built in the first quarter of the 1900's. Not sure when, but they used the wall board that came in 8' x 2' sections and then they plastered over the entire surface. That's fine, but at some point around 1960, they remodeled this bathroom with today's sheetrock and simply placed it over the top of the old stuff. When I removed the old mortar based tile, it left me with about an inch and a quarter space to fill. I simply cut some 1 by's into strips and furred out the studs, then prepped the surface with mud to create a level playing field and covered it with Schluter membrane. It worked out fine.

Normally, I would have just ripped it out from floor to ceiling, but that would have left me with a big un-popcorned strip along the edge of the ceiling and I didn't want to have to deal with that crap and I didn't want to have to put in crown to cover it up.

Live and learn.Exploring is exactly what I was doing when I posted this post. I already thought about shimming, I already thought about adding the stud or studs, I just wanted to hear other ideas cause im always up for learning something new, I got some respectable responses and one not so respectable response.....my mom always told me son...if ya dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all.I don't tile
But, I have a great tile guy who I have framed for.
That's what he does: he uses CBB that is the same thickness as the drywall and puts the seam under the bullnose and a nailer under the seam.

You have two choices listed above.Jondnkb
Another way to eliminate the crown is to remove 1/8" (+-) from the stud you are joining the two materials on. This insets the two materials and finishes flush. Very easy if you are framing but can be done to existing studs.
Bill TJust wondering if a spray foamed roof interior can be coupled with other roof sections, in the same home, that also contains vented attic spaces.

So long as the vented spaces are sealed properly, I'd assume it should be okay? Or is it important to stick with one or the other throughout?Going to need detail or pictures...... the materials involved and venting will dictateRed Adobe said:

Good pointThere are 3 gable sections with 12 in 12 pitch and two 4 in 12 shed-type roof sections. The sections that will have normal attic spaces already have ridge vents and I plan to vent the soffits. 

The reason I want to use spray foam is that I'm opening to cathedral ceiling in the long gable and adding a small loft. I don't want to have to fur down a lot or lose headroom in the loft to gain full R value + proper ventilation. 

The 4 in 12 shed roof section has 2x6 rafters and very little headroom for me to add depth for batt insulation or blown in + venting.

Wondering if it's stupid to consider this hybrid rather than be consistent with a retrofit unvented roof throughout.

Here's a very simple drawing of the basic roof layout.As long as the conditioned attic / cathedral sections are fully separated & insulated from the other areas you should be fine. Be careful that the HO understands that they are going to have to use exhaust fans (and they are vented outside) or you can run into moisture issues esp. in the hot roof areas. 

Personally going all open cell in those areas would not be my first choice, but if done properly it can work.SLS Construction & Building Solutions LLC Our Blog - The HTRCI think what I should be using is closed cell, but I've heard mixed opinions on open cell w/ vapor barrier vs closed cell. If I had the room to drop the ceiling enough to properly insulate and vent, I would, but I don't have much to work with. 

Current roof venting is kind of random and haphazardly installed gable vents with recently added ridge vents (corrugated roll out type that don't seem like they're pulling much).I think one of the biggest issues here is... how much ventilation space do you leave between the sprayed underside of the roof, and the sheetrock (or whatever) ceiling? I'm not sure how the spray whether it be closed cell or not, will effect the moisture issue.

I would't chance it either. It would be an exensive re-do later.KermieB said:

If there's no venting, what's does it matter how much space between the drywall and foam insulation?Because closed cell insulations effectiveness does not increase as much as you'd think with greater thickness.

If you can do a pre-vent on the cathedral sections before the spray guys arrive, you will actually extend the life of the roof with an air channel on the underside of the roof sheeting.

You did say there was a ridge vent, no?-Scottthe ridge is vented. good to know. i suppose ill want to add soffit venting too.What does the insulation contractor have to say about it ?Expect the UnexpectedBig Shoe said:

TomI came across this gem when demoing a bathroom today. It had previously been remodeled with a second story added on years ago. 

The second floor joist (2x6 @9' span) run parallel to the floor joist (also same span 2x6). This wall is not really load bearing by design, but the load has shift as a result of the joist deflection. The support beam is 3' away from this wall that separates the bath from the hallway. I put in new joist along all existing floor joist, but this king studs are only being held by 80 year old Douglas fir hardwood. 

I have a few ideas on how to address both of the king studs to carry the point load, but am curious what you would prefer short of shoring the ceiling and gutting it and reframing the entire wall and door. 

This was a simple refresh and subfloor repair to install new tile that went down hill. Installing blocking under the king studs, pouring footing (dirt floor in basement) and installing a steel post under each king stud seems to be the easy way handle it. 

What are your thoughts?Remodeling Contractor Scranton PA

Scranton PA Kitchen RemodelingWhat do you mean by "king studs are only being held by 80 year old Doug for hardwood"?The king and jack studs on each side of the doorway are in the middle of the joist bays. These old houses often had no subfloors, just finished hardwood direct nailed to joist. 

As you can see in the pic, the load from the door header is forcing the studs downward, the hardwood has cracked from the pressure. The load path needs to be carried by structure to resolve the issue.Remodeling Contractor Scranton PA

Scranton PA Kitchen RemodelingOh okay that makes more sense now. Sounds to me like that's a good plan of attack. Sorry I can't offer any better advice, I'm still pretty new to building trades. About all the work I've ever done has been in crazy old buildings so I know what a bucket of worms it always is.Fire Fire Fire Beaviswww.shelladditions.comAround here we usually pour a footing in the basement and support it with a steel post.We run string lines and check all of the existing beams and shim where needed (if there is something to shim against) or pour footings and posts to level.
Easiest and cheapest to do which is most often what the HO wants.
Load bearing or not it's nice to have a flat (not always level) floor.Brace the floor in the basement

Insert a beam parallel to the doorway.

If you can spam the beam from bearing point to bearing point under the doorway, even better.

About tearing out the framing around the door?

Not necessary.

Put in the beam to stabilize.

If you think you can jack it up a bit with a few bottle jacks to "straighten" the floor, without cracking all the plaster, have at it.










This is not the exact application, but a beam can be inserted into old framing without destroying the wall, ceiling joists and in this case the cripple studs.-Scottmako1 said:

The deflection from the beam to that area is about 3/4 down, at the mid span of the joist (middle of bath floor) it was down about 1 1/2". With the timeline and budget on this, it won't get level. It would require new joist in the entire house. I'm there to strengthen and flatten the bath as much as possible, put down SLC to level the bath, install tile, fixtures, paint, etc. 

I think I will block that entire wall (10' or so), set a drop beam riding on 4 steel post... I don't want my tile cracking. 

Unfortunately for the owner, he had the painter there last week patching and painting the surrounding rooms. :/Remodeling Contractor Scranton PA

Scranton PA Kitchen RemodelingI have the same problem in my house. I have a beam that is attached to the walls on either side and set on the hardwood. I didn't check before sheetrocking it and now I have a small deflection in the floor and am not sure if it is new or been there all along.

I'm just going to crawl underneath and set a beam with 3 piers in the spot the old long gone continuous wall was. Two under each end to support the "posts" and one in the middle to support the floor. I have two spots I need to do it, so I'll just do them both at once. Luckily it is an 18-20 inch crawlspace, so it will be simple.

On your's I would just simply set a beam or tripled 2x with a post underneath each side of the door between the joists if it isn't over a basement. These old houses are pretty resilient, so anything you can do to add a little strength will work fine.philcav7 said:

Seems like a bunch of work and now the homeowner has to deal with two posts and a low beam in the basement/ crawler.....

Blocking and hangers would have done the same thing by simply transferring the load to the existing double 2x6 joists. and you could have done this everywhere you needed extra support........

Steel casements can be a nightmare sawzalling out the frames. Then you often have no interior trim because those steel frames were plastered in.

2 to 3 times more then average.
Also heavy on telemarketing.Seems like a ridiculous price up front, but without knowing what they have to do to remove and replace, it is hard to pass judgement. There is obviously a lot more work to removing steel casements from a board and batten then a typical brick veneer installation, where they remove the sashes, slip the replacement window in the existing frame, secure with 4 or six screws, caulk, and go home. My vision here is that there is going to be carpentry work involved both for ro work and exterior trim.
Have never had any experience with that brand in my area, perhaps it is a regional product, like many replacement window makers.Wow.

We have no information at all regarding this estimate. We only know that someone gave a HO a quote. 

We all get pissed off when someone's brother-in-law's cousins' sister's old boyfriend says we're ripping them off. But yet that's exactly what this thread is doing. 

Post the entire written estimate so we can see the facts or all we're doing is talking through our a$$.I think a $1000. is a little high and I don't like Champion windows nor do I like the high pressure sales tactics they use. But, I don't think $1000. is way out of line. Considering the steel pans have to be torn out and the entire window reframed, insulated and new brickmold added to the inside. We typically charge an extra $200-$300 per opening depending on the size. Even with a Simonton window, when you start considering the size, adding options like superspacer, tempered glass, grids etc., you could be talking pretty close to $1000.

I'd like to know more details on the quote, but the price doesn't seem outrageous to me.Radiant barrier insulation, energy efficient windows and doors, eco friendly remodeling in Northern VAIf she is willing to pay that i'll do em for 900 ea and catch a flight there tonightLearning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.$850.00 @ ???Thom, I agree with Tom M.

Thom, did you mean each window would cost $1000 per window or the overall price divided by the total number of windows works out to $1000?

There are a lot of factors that can influence that final number, and with Champion, you are paying for a salesman, salesmanager, support staff, marketing, etc... and this is before you get to the product. 

IMHO, find a window you feel confident in (construction, amenities, etc.) that is available in Asheville, and contact the manufacturer. Any good one will have contractors they can refer you to in their network that won't have the same load (see above) that can help reduce that cost...

Tried a search but couldn't find anything specific. Real curious how the pros and seasoned veterans handle the following scenario:

Say your client orders solid masonite (or otherwise) prehung doors where the jamb is the standard 4 9/16. When you arrive onsite, the house is plaster and lath making the jambs much wider than the opening.

Do you:


Place the Jamb in the opening, scribe the cut line, disassemble and run through table saw? Then reassemble? 
Place door in opening, cut strike jamb or hinge side jamb to make header level, screw top hinge side and then put in guides and cut around the door with a circ saw as close to finished wall?
Attach 1x spreaders to the jamb and somehow run the entire jamb through a table saw awkwardly ?

Took more time than I'd like to admit getting this prehung door cut right and hung (actually the bottom is still binding against the hinge jamb a bit) Just looking for a quicker way since I have two more to do.



Thanks,

HarryUsually with lath and plaster the wall thickness winds up greater than 4 9/16"s, so I'm a little confused how your jambs are too big and need to be cut.. But if this were the case, I'd probably disassemble the jamb,run through a table saw and then reassemble.I would probably pop it apart and run it through the table saw. If you get the chance next time, order them from a door shop the right size.

Of course, I can't say much. I installed a used exterior door I had in my house and just let the jambs run wild. I'll invent some kind of impressive solution in the next 6 months or so, or at least before it starts raining. :laughing:Seasoned vets don't let the h/o order the doors.

I hear you man. I was a bit surprised too but when I needed to pry those staples off from the jamb connection that's when I wondered there had to be a better way. That was a PITA. I'm thinking next time I'll try and cut them off using a Dremel with a flush cut blade.gbruzze1 said:

What I noticed was the original lumber was placed on it's side such that I'm getting 1.5" (close to it) for the jamb. The face of the 2x4 is facing the hall. I'm sure there is a reason they did it this way back then, but that explains why both sides were way smaller than the 4 9/16.I just installed two of those same doors. I picked them up at Diamond Lumber in S. Jersey. Nice heavy door.

I have had to cut several of those doors because a lot of homes in Philly are framed with 2x3's. So, you have the option of custom ordering a door with a smaller jam, or buy stock and cut.

I removed the door from the jam leaving the jam in tact and just cut the jam with my circular saw and a guide. Then, I'd clean up the cut with my block plane or sander if needed. 

Never a problem, added maybe an hour to the whole job.Jonjb4211 said:

Lugging up the door up 3 flights of stairs really put me to the test..lol. I think it's heavy. And had to wonder about the guys who install these doors without taking the door off. I suppose it can be done, I'm not that quick (good) yet.

I assume you're cutting from inside the door way facing the finished side of the jamb. How are you locating and guiding the cut up the finished wall? Let's say the finished wall isn't perfectly square riding up the jamb?No. I cut the door jam prior to installation.

You can cut the jam with - or without - the door attached to the jam.

I use the guide that slides into the saw and just let it ride against the jam, go slow, sharp blade and make sure the guide stays against the jam.

I cut the jams square. I don't compensate for wavy walls by making the jams wavy. I'd do something else. I'd have to see the particular situation.

All that being said, this is not for high end, million dollar homes. For those situations, I may disassemble the jam completely and run each jam through the table saw and reassemble. For customers with smaller budgets, I can achieve very good results using my circular saw.

I also have a Makita power planer that is great at reducing the width of the jam if the amount is minimal.JonI hope they paid you for all that extra labor.-Scottjb4211 said:

I ended up disassembling the jam and running it through the table saw. It was a major PITA getting those staples off, but it made it easier for me to run it through the table saw. I put it back together with some itebond and 4 2 1/2 16ga nails. I lined up the jamb, scribed a line flush with the wall and did my best to line up with that line, being a little proud. It came out ok, not perfect. When I throw up casing, I know i'm going to need to shim out certain areas to make the miters meet nicely.Sometimes, that's unavoidable.

Are you charging for the extra?JonMy brother like the jams to be a little proud. I'm not a fan.

I prefer my casing to sit flush with the wall and jam.

Can you correct the imperfections before attaching casing?

How did they look?Depends on the design I guess. I've installed 12" base and uppers on the same wall with a little counter on the base. Mostly in places like a bathroom. 

Like I said if it is designed well and flows with the room, perfectly fine.My tools are always yelling at me cause the wife and kids take up too much room.Agreed.

I could take a picture but we've done that exact thing in our kitchen to make almost a bar like area. Small kitchen and didn't have a lot of cabinet space and couldn't do full depth. Wall cabinets set on a 2x4 platform to match the toe kick height everywhere else with the taller finished end panels and toe kick across the front makes for a nice looking little cabinet section.Good to hear.

Depends on what tools you have and how well the cabinets are built.

I've done some cabinet modifications with my track saw and it has been a major time saver and turned out perfect. But you still have to deal with the back panel, shelf pin holes, shelves etc. All depends on what kind of cabinets you're dealing with.Losing half of the holes and having to redrill them to match existing alone would not make it faster/easierA client of mine has a 1960s brick home standard crawlspace foundation. The client wants to insulate the home from the inside, she has no problem gutting the rooms with exterior walls. Insulating from the outside isn't an option, she doesn't want to disturb the brick. She wants some sound proofing but nothing expensive or major, just basically better than the old R11 fiberglass she has currently. Her main focus is insulation value, they want as much R-value as possible without the expense of spray foam. My current thoughts and proposals to her are as follows...

OPTION 1 - Insulate using denim R-15 batts followed by foil-faced polyiso 1.5" thick, then drywall. 

OPTION 2 - Rip 2x4s in half, fasten to existing studs creating a deeper bay so that R-19 denim batts can be installed, followed by 1" political then drywall.

What do you guys think? Better options? Am I on the right track?If you're gutting, I'd consider blowing the walls, you'll get much less air movement through the wall. If you strap the wall out, putting extensions on all the windows and exterior doors isn't too difficult, but the electrical boxes may not have enough wire to be moved to the new wall plane.

If you run 2x2s or 2X3s horizontal to make the wall thicker you get less thermal bridging and you can shim the attachment points as you go to get the wall in plane, but you potentially have more air movement through the wall assembly.

Either way, get all penetrations air sealed while the wall is open.Dittos with HDavis on essentially all counts, dense packed cellulose - make sure you take care of any moisture / flashing issues or it will cost you big time

The biggest issue really isn't the R-Value, it is air sealing & then installing the insulation properly especially as it relates to the attic

As for foil based poly - not worth the money (at least the foil) as you need to have an air gap for the radiant barrier to be of any use. Besides even if you had it on the right side it would be a waste as the brick with that air gap actually deals with that.SLS Construction & Building Solutions LLC Our Blog - The HTRCThe only reason i would be using foil faced poly is because of all the rigid foam in my area, it has the greatest R-value per inch. As for dense packed cellulose i immediately considered that option, the only thing keeping me from it is the client wants to work 1 room at a time because she will be living there at the time of the renovations.

When she got the price tag for all her items ( which was about 30k) she went online in search for those items abit cheaper..found a lot of her stuff on e faucets and now wants me to do all the ordering through this website..the items are pretty much the same price except they give a 5% discount and so no tax and free shipping..my question is 1. What are the dangers is any for using one of these sites and 2 how would you handle a customer price shopping online?The biggest issue with online ordering is if something comes in incorrect or damaged. You have to deal with a reputable online company. It's really no different than special orders. But what I do is have my customer use their resources to order and pay for them, it frees up my time and resources. If I order items I usually try and stick to Amazon and items sold by them. I'm a Prime member and if something comes in wrong they will ship me a replacement the next day one day shipping free of charge and I have 30 days to ship the other item back free of charge.

I have jobs where every single item is special order or ordered online. The special orders are usually what I have issues with not the online orders.

When the economy went to crap nobody stocked anything.I'd be careful with the tax implications, even though you're purchasing online in many states you're supposed to report it and pay it.rustyjames said:

To my knowledge the only time you're charged sales tax is if that online retailer has a brick and mortar store in your state. It's the retailers responsibility to add and pay that tax.When sales tax is not charged by the seller on a taxable item or service, the consumer is required by law to report and remit use tax to the Department of Revenue. Purchases made over the Internet, through toll-free numbers, from mail-order catalogs and from out-of-state locations are examples of purchases subject to use tax when sales tax is not paid.

http://www.revenue.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/use_tax_for_individuals/20576So then I should probably have them order all the stuff then..probably better that wayThen I take it you don't add any markup to material costs? Not saying you should or shouldn't; you can make money either way.

But as touched upon above, if your client does all of the procuring, can you count on having all the proper materials and quantities on hand when you start the job? Even if you have penalty clauses in your contract for such things, enforcing them can leave a bitter taste.Stu04 said:

 that. They used your suppliers showroom and expertise to pick the damn fixtures and then want to nickel and dime about the overhead to run that showroom and the expertise. 

I am busy now days, so I refuse to install or warranty the fixture, neither one. If the client had ordered the fixtures before I was hired thats different, but I still wont warranty the fixture. If they do what your client did, install when I am done. 

This is a small town, Im need the suppliers more than one cheap client.

Ya unless you're getting paid to order and return/warranty hassle if something's wrong I would make it the customer's responsibility. I charge for my time, locally or not.

I've had customers do online ordering for years. More people are wanting to buy the material themselves, thinking they save money. I explain to them if there's an issue it's all in their hands. Some buy locally some don't.

Like I said I've had many issues with special order items, that's neither the customer's fault nor mine, but it held up the job. Almost every remodel job I do involves online ordering of some kind. Either that or special order because nobody stocks crap.Stu04 said:

I consider this to be spam - soliciting business, with no contribution to the discussion.- BobThis comes up sometimes. I usually just let the customer get the items. Of course I make them order it and deal with it. The cost is usually minor so it hasn't been an issue for me. 
If you order something online and the business has a brick and mortar store in your state they will charge you tax. If they don't have a brick and mortar in your state, it is your responsibility to report it to your state and pay sales tax to your state. 
As far as I know it is like that in all states. 
This has been in the news alot lately. There is a push from states to make all websites charge the appropriate sales tax for the products. Amazon is fighting it.CarpenterSFO said:

I definitely understand your concern about keeping this forum spam free. I haven't been a member long, but have read through the sites rules and policy. This site seems to help a lot of contractors and I wouldn't want to jeopardize it's integrity. 

However we have developed a strategy to avoid profit loss to the internet. One owner is from your industry, the other from the granite fabrication industry. They experience first hand the neglect from the major brands when the internet started drastically reducing value, so they decided to do something about it. We started ten years ago with 3 employees and now have closer to 100. A HUGE part of this growth has been because of our ability to let our customers make a significant profit by avoiding online price cutting. 

P.S ---Trust me I can't stand reading the ESPN comments and seeing "I make 10,000 a week from home etc etc etc". So I really do understand the concern.Nathan Bennett

www.mrdirectint.comEvery now and then I have a client that does the same thing. I don't have a problem with it because they usually are waiting for a month or two for their turn in line so there is plenty of time to get products ordered and waiting for me. In these instances, I usually drop by and inspect the stuff when it arrives just to make sure they have everything I need.

As for the mark up on materials, that doesn't change regardless of who is buying the products. My mark up and tax for the product is built into my quote so my allowance sheet doesn't show any of that, and when a client buys the products them self I simply deduct the entire allowance for that item which means I end up making mark up on the original price. If they upgrade and spend more than I had allowed... oh well, so be it, but since I'm not having to funnel money through my account, I don't care. It's free money.

I do however, void my self of having to gaurantee the items. So, in reality I come out better when they buy on line. 

As a side note.... Have any of you ever had a client that just didn't grasp the whole "allowance" procedure? I had given this woman an allowance of $300 for a sink on a kitchen rebuild. Well she goes out and buys a $1,200 bronze farm sink, so when I submit my invoice that week I showed a deduction of $300 for a customer purchased item. Oh no... she said I owed her a $1,200 deduction because that's what she spent. I asked her if she was sure about that, so she thought for a minute and laughed and said she had made a mistake and I only owed her a $900 deduction. Yes, eventually she figured it out.BTW, the client that I'm working for now bought her own sink and had it waiting on me and when I saw it, it told me a lot about her personality and I actually changed the design of the bathroom based on that sink.

Here it is....Whenever I have this situation, I ask the client if their peace of mind is worth the money that they save. I always refer back to a swing gate opener that I installed in 2010. The HO paid a premium price but when the main circuit board failed 6 months after the warranty ran out, the local distributor had enough influence with the manufacturer to swap out the part out the next day...no questions asked.

The other thing that I consider is that when you buy stuff online, you don't know if you are getting something that is warrantied by the manufacturer or if it was just surplus material from another job which could very well be out of warranty due to the length of time between when it was acquired by the web-based company to the time that you actually got it from Amazon.

Any time you have a warranty issue with something that is normally purchased through an authorized distributor, the manufacturer always wants to know where/when you bought it before they do anything. And if it happens so that you didn't get it through one of their distributors, they won't be able to help you.I'm always looking for the answer to my troubles at the bottom of a paint can.I'm not a carpenter so bear with me.bearing ?????

Old fashioned---and simple---except for the cost of the trim---that's a lot of trim---For me, parting stop has always been 1/2" x 3/4" square edge. Door/window stop is 1 3/8" x 3/8".Get a piece of door stop, parting stop and screen moulding, show them to the person speccing the stop and ask them which one they would like you to use.

In this case I'd lean towards the parting stop, but that is not my call.

I wouldn't assume the structure would handle the added loads - you'd need a peek to see. Codes may also want to see - maybe the footings as well.

Then there's any interior holes for electric, hvac, etc. that have to be run. No way to tell how much it's going to cost to to get everything patched and matched.

Then, there is always the esthetics...THe budget number doesn't sound like a strong confirmationOP hasn't been back for a week.

Andy.https://andytardif.wixsite.com/websiteI figured I would start this thread here now. We just purchased a 1700sq. ft. split level home in a nearby suburb. 

Closing was today. 

It's not a full gut by any means but does need some considerable work. Should keep me busy for the next couple of months.

I went from "I'm going to make a serious amount of money" to "I'm going to make a decent amount of money" to "well, I'll make something at least, and after all, it is just my first one" to " I hope I break even" to "man, this sucks".... Lol.

Major Projects:

Mostly rewired
New Furnace
Flooring throughout
A bathroom remod 
Trim and doors
Paint


I'll add to the list as necessary.

Kitchen was remodeled in 09 and isn't bad besides some damaged cabinet doors. Hardwood throughout, but it's beat up pretty bad. Definitely replacing in LR either way but will get a refinisher in to see of bedrooms are salvageable. If not, carpet.

Roof is in decent shape and will stay, gutters may need some attention. 

Got a good amount of demo done yesterday and I was happy with the lack of stuff I found :laughing:

Should be a good project for me.Kameron Brooks

I hear you. Not overly concerned with cracking into this business but obviously don't wanna lose my shirt. 

It's paid in cash so no carrying costs-got that going for me.

House isn't in bad shape. Decent family lived there, took care of the place. They passed in July and willed the house to a younger relative. He happened to be a junkie. So it's a good house with dumb stuff like the copper from the floor to the valve missing under the sinks, some wiring cut out in the basement, etc.

www.iFixHomeImprovement.com3 months for two guys should be pretty doableI am remodeling a home damaged by a recent flood. The entire house has been stripped to the studs and mold remediated. 

The rear exterior wall of the house is nuts. Another contractor started reframing and has done some silly stuff, which should be clear in the photo (note the random furred out 1x and 2x on the beam). The room appears to have originally been some sort of sun room. The rear exterior wall is made up of a series of 4x4 treated posts supporting a double 2x10 beam. Studs have been framed in between the posts, running all the way down to the sill plate, and up to a series of top plates fastened to the bottom of the beam, between the posts.
Here's (some of) the trouble- all of the studs are out of plane with each other and out of plane with the beam resting on the 4x4s, with a variance of anywhere from 1" to 2", and none of the studs are 16" on center. They are also all fastened to the exterior sheathing from the outside, under the vinyl siding. To make matters worse, the wall is intended to be a kitchen wall- the entire length of it (about 120") will have wall and base cabinets. 

Never mind the existing rough electric and cabinet blocking... I know that will need to be redone.

My question is this: can I frame up a new wall, 2x3 or 2x4, in front of the existing exterior wall? The stud bays won't match up, and the new cavity (from drywall to sheathing) will be deeper than a 2x6 wall. Does this violate fire code? Is there an easier solution?

I just want a straight wall for my drywall and cabinets.

Any advice will help.Don't know where you are located so fire code question is for your local building inspector. 

Framing a straight,plumb wall in front of existing is a great solution. I'd do that.I think you need to talk with your local inspector. Just use 10' or 12' drywall laid sideways if you want to line up the studs. You might have to drywall over the existing and put a 2" x 4" wall in front of that.Install plumb studs in the corners, pull string stud to stud, top, middle, bottom, sister in new studs kissing the string. Place the studs in the bays prior to setting the string, notch studs around obstructions, they will get nailed to the existing.

TomWhy the question about if it will violate fire code?

Is this a town home or condo?

Is the existing wall in the set-back or something?

It is a two-story, single-family detached house. 

I asked about fire code because I'm not terribly familiar with it in this particular case. I feel pretty confident about what to expect from a framing inspection, but in this case I'm not sure. Usually I fur out problem walls because space is an issue (3 1/2" in this case), particularly in a kitchen. I haven't ever consider framing a new wall altogether to conceal an old one, and haven't found info anywhere on the web about it.

I'm not sure what you mean by set-back... like from the street?tjbnwi said:

I considered this but was hesitant due to the following: 1) Each new stud would be notched out for the remaining 9 inches or so to account for the beam. 2)What would I use as a top and bottom plate, if anything, to account for the different dimensions of each new stud? 3) If I fasten the new studs to the existing studs, they will still not be 16 on center.

I'm trying to weigh the costs/benefits of each, particularly in terms of man-hours.Tom's method saves space. The wall may also be more even at "tie ins" to existing walls. Also, you can add studs to make your 16 on centers.
Depending on how out of plumb studs and beam are, your "new wall method" may save a lot of time in framing. It might add in electrical or plumbing time,though.winterfool said:

1) Can you end the stud at the beam, the beam then becomes the "top plate". Hopefully the existing beam is straight-See #2.

2) See #1, if that won't work pad the beam with plywood, and drywall shims. Bottom plate can be any infill. You don't need a bottom plate where the lower/full height cabinets will go, only areas where base will be installed.

3) Who care if it is 16" on center? This is not a load bearing wall. I have not broke a sheet of drywall on a framing member in years. You're installing cabinet blocking. Stud layout means nothing and does not matter.

TomI have three bathroom remodel jobs on the books and estimated the number of hours for each job and submitted the proposal's and was accepted. My question is...has anyone tracked some small bathroom remodel jobs and can provide feedback on total number of hours involved? These bathrooms are of the 6x9 flavor with an old iron tub, lavatory, sink with just a little flooring repair, new vinyl, 1 piece and everything else new including base, case, paint and light.72chevy4x4 said:

Man theres so many variables involved in the equation to give a good answer IMO

do you have to relocate any waste or water lines, what about electrical...is there access in the attic for electrical junctions. What about sheetrock repairs, are you performing these tasks or are you subbing that to others?A.W. Davis Construction Co.
http://www.awdavisremodel.com/
Your friendly remodeling contractorI know there can be so many variables-like sheetrock work after the tub comes out. For the most part, small patches on the wall and nothing is getting 'moved'-just straight hook ups. I'm changing out the light fixture, but not changing the wiring. these are basic jobs, nothing fancy.Remove/replace tub? what kind of tub goes out, then in? Access?
Remove/replace flooring? what goes out, what goes in?
Remove/replace sink or vanity? what goes out, what goes in?
Remove/replace window?
Remove/replace fan?
Remove/replace wall finishes and tub surrounds? out and in?

One week.....wow thats amazing!! I am not doubting your abilities at all, just amazed!!

It usually takes me on average at least 1/2 day of demo, 1/2 day of plumbing relocation, 1/2 day of electrical relocation 2 days to rehang rock, tape and texture on small bathroom jobs, then if theres tile everywhere no way will it be completed in 5 days. And lets not forget about setting the tub, setting the vanity cabinets, hanging the light fixtures, baseboard, blahh blahh blahh. 

When it's all said and done I usually finish an averaged size bathroom (8'x8') in roughly 3-4 weeks if I didnt come across any unforseen issues such as dry rot or whatever else. I guess I am slow but it doesnt bother me.A.W. Davis Construction Co.

I figure 1/2 day tear-out, plumbing relocated and tub in place, 

Window, framing repairs, electric second day.

Sheetrock, tile backer, first coat mud third day,

Wall tile, second, third coats mud forth day

Paint, flooring, set commode, and vanity/top fifth day

First day is long, second and third fairly easy, forth full and fifth long.

Work with one othe guy, a laborer. I'm licensed and quite competent as a GC, Plumbing Contractor, Electrical Contractor and a few more, And, I work fast.

We did a major truck stop remodel that included relocating the fueling desk to the opposite end of the area (about 150'). We had to move fueling controlls, scale controlls, credit card system, networked computer system, phones, the whole thing, in a business that never stops. Their engineer gave me 1/2 hour window during which we could have them shut down. They were up and running in 20 minutes. Afterwards he told me they had never completed one with a shut down of less than 2 hours. He said he didn't believe it was possible to do it in an hour or less before seeing us do it in 20 minutes.Patriotism is being loyal to your country all the time and your government when it deserves it.

Thats a fair timetable but even with a small window and electric we would be sheetrocking and installing the concrete backer board on the second day,we'll split up if the window needs to be replaced,one in one out.tile can be started third day and finished the following morning if needed.The tile is the key ,get it down as quickly as posible so it can be walked on as soon as posible.5 days is very reasonable,thats not counting other variables severe water damage to framing or floor,extensive plumbing relocation,elaborate tile work,skylights,vaulting and so on.and of course if all the tradesmen show up when there suppose to.:laughing:Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.I'm not sure what the definition of a "small" bathroom is, but I generally allow 10 man-hours of electrical work for a second-story bathroom in an older home (2 men, 5 hours). This is considering pulling new circuit from the panel, vanity light, GFCI or two, fan/light unit, and venting the fan by some means. Add 1-1/2 man-hours for jetted tub. Less time when walls are stripped, and even less if existing fan venting means exists.Man, I guess no one has to stop to wait for inspections. Around me, that can make us lose a week!

Theoretically, a full gut 5 x 7 bath could be a 5 day job, but in my world, it's 5 days of work spread out over three weeks from demo to final paint and punch out.Your source for:

You know you have to have multiple jobs going due to down time at a location but time always gets lost. Sometimes that other job isnt working out the way you hoped either. There should be a minimum of 35% profit on this type of job for this very reason.Baths are the worst bid to do because you never know what you will run into.

My worst was stucco over wood exterior wall bumpout for a shower stall. Nothing was done right. Rot started at the bottom and then termites took over. 

Hurricanes Francis and Jeanne took full advantage, collapsed the wall and pressurised the house causing the sliders to blow out causing major water damage.

Funny what damage only ONE small leak can do.You can't solve you're problems with the same level of thinking that created the problems. 

Albert EinsteinHow long to remodel a small bath? We just done one. We did not gut to studs. We did remove shower stall, install drywall, texture and paint. Removed old tile and installed new flooring, relocated plumbing for vanity, clawfoot tub, and toilet. Installed all with fixtures. Relocated vanity light and outlet. Installed new base and shoe, etc. Myself and my helper, it took us about 2, 40 hr weeks to complete We did do some additional work in the closet during this time. Size of bath was 8 x 11T.C.​"Never met a man yet that I couldn't learn something from"
Met a few you couldn't teach though :w00t:​ http://remodelingncarolina.comI've done several bath remodels using just myself and a helper and it has taken between two and three full working weeks each time. I'm in the middle of my first using subs. Plaster walls were gutted to studs and bare slab, then all debris was removed in a huge F-150 load to dump on Monday. Sparky came tuesday did all wiring, 3 cans, and set fan in 6 hours, plumber came wednesday and set tub, roughed in shower valve, raised toilet supply for base clearance, and installed bullets (copper stub outs) for toilet and sink...all in about 4 hours. Called for inspection wasnt able to get one until today..(which I'm leaving for in a few minutes)...drywall will be first thing next week...(one day to hang, tape and texture according to drywall sub), tile guy comes tuesday....I fugure 2 and a half working weeks for this one. If all keeps going smoothly....nice profit.ok if you are remodeling a bathroom depends on the bathroom size
and what is involve such as
demolition can be really tricky you have to analyze what type of material you have on the walls and ceiling a lot times is build with plaster that has mash
and that can take you one or two days depending on the case.
if the work you are doing this work with permits that's another thing you have to consider cose when you get permits you cant just start and finish in one round 
there are a few steps you have to follow - ELECTRICAL - PLUMBING - INSULATION - BUILDING - and sometimes depending in the town you also will need FIRE
and after you pass all those wait for the final
so in average one bathroom 8x8' it will take about two weeks or more depending the town inspection schedule.I'd go more but sounds like you answered your own question!!!

Nj around 15kI did my buddies for around 8 grand!This an old thread:blink:I can't compete with hacks.Need some help with hazy thinking today. 

I need to place an order for replacement kitchen doors. I already have the exact door width & height measurements, and noted a 1/2" overlay. 

The site I'm working with offers 5/8" overlay hinges which I'd like to just order, if possible. (I have enough room for that.) What tweaks to my door width specs do I need to make? I can't seem to wrap my head around it today. For opposing doors (door pairs), I believe I add only 1/8" to the width to get my doors to meet properly....and add 1/4" to the width for the single doors (1/8" x 2). I think that's it, right? Thanks much.

Edit: Disregard this post. Got it sorted out. Thanks.5/8 " overlay is on each side and top and bottom.This is the overlay on the face frame.

Good question. I'm dealing with partial overlay doors for a home sale prep, and there's room "visually" on the face frame for that little bit of difference (1/2" vs. 5/8" works here)....and I can then include it in the same order (bores and hinge sets) as my doors. Not ideal, but it will work just fine for this job.....the existing doors were DIY 1/2" ply, by the way, still unfinished. (Why, I don't know.)Drill them youself on site.
It's safer and less likely to have screw ups.

Another good question. Honestly...it's a project with some serious budget considerations. The old hinges are mounted on the front of the face frames. It will be easier to remove them, fill & stain the holes, and then use adjustable hinges. Not ideal, but you'd have to see the existing to understand.I've got a typical 15 year old master bathroom that has a shower and jacuzzi. Homeowners no longer want the jacuzzi.

I'm struggling with what to do with the layout when I remove the jacuzzi. There are two windows on the walls around the jacuzzi so I can't move the shower over there. Shower is getting replaced.

Everything is getting redone but I'd prefer not move plumbing if I can find a layout solution to make the space where the jacuzzi was look correct.

Storage cabinet with a nice top. Towels inside, statue or other art on top.
Bench seat, with storage beneath
Mini laundry
Extreme towel-warming station
Shooting station with spotting scope for target practice and to shoot deer in the back yard. Convenient clothesline for running targets out to back fence for pistol practice.
BBQ
Nice Jacuzzi tub

Storage is probably your best bet.

Edit: Comfortable reading chair. I never really got it, but some people like to use their bathroom as a comfy little retreat.

Edit again: Not moving the plumbing obviously restricts your choices. You could run the vanity top a little farther into the corner, put a chair there, and have a make-up station, but the light from the window behind isn't great for that use.- BobYou can do something like thisI never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​greg24k said:

That one might depend on how high the windows are.- BobI thought of that, but being there was a Jacuzzi, possibly sitting on a platform which is approximately 21-22" high + a row of tile surround at min 6" high he might get lucky and clear the window... maybe use Toto low boy toilet which is about 28" tall. In worst case scenario keep the blinds down when on it, but IMO it makes a nice layout without having fixtures all over the place.I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​Nothing? Bench seat?

Depending on the window height I would leave it open or put a triangle bench there.his and her toiletstipitop;2814937 said:

I'd put my shower there and leave the windows uncovered.I could move plumbing if need be. It will depend on what the HO wants. 

They are doing a $75-100k addition so I'm trying to help them out by keeping the cost down on this bathroom. That being said if the layout they want involves moving plumbing I'll encourage them to do that. It is the master bathroom.Lewis CarpentryThanks for all the input.

I ended up using cabinetry to fill up the space. See attached pics. It will be something like this. One of them won't get a mirror where the window is.Lewis CarpentrySpencer, I would encourage you to use the windows to the maximum since they are not being moved... Your eyes go to the farther distance when you enter a room and that is how you absorb space and colors... in this case, the layout draws your eyes to the windows so you want to maximize their effect... The below drawing gives them a two-person shower and vanity layout (with both being able to have mirrors) but at the same time with the linen closet to the right and half-wall to the left with glass above it, it gives the same water closet feel to the toilet without feeling cramped because of the glass and adding the utility of a linen pantry...

A nice little feature of the false front (often underutilized space) is that it is an ideal spot for custom toothbrush, razor and accessory holder instead of messing up the counterspace... I would also encourage working in an automated soap dispenser (based on motion - $20)...

Personally, in addition to the regular shower faucet, I would add a waterfall head above the center...

That is very nice. You have a gift in design. Unfortunately that isn't in the budget as much as I'd love to do it. I'm tucking that design away in my mind for next time.Lewis CarpentrySpencer said:

The walk in shower is what kills it. That would add an easy 8k to the cost. 

I agree. Moving plumbing wouldn't be that bad and showing someone you can think up some cool stuff will sell. 

Honestly, I've got enough going in this job. 1200 sq ft worth of tile to lay. Couple hundred of hardwood. All the trim. And this bathroom to redo. That in itself is a few weeks smack in the middle of the busiest time of the year. I'm good with what were doing now but I do appreciate that you took the time to do the design. I learn a lot on threads like this.Lewis CarpentryI'm looking to see how you guys charge for siding installation. For this topic I'm referring to D4 Vinyl Siding. If you don't mind sharing, what do you charge per square for installation only?

While I'm asking, what about aluminum soffit and fascia? 

Typically I charge by the job, based off experience I figure about how long it will take to complete and provide an estimate. I've never charged by the square, but figure it might streamline things and make estimating straight forward.

Thanks!Straight pricing questions are taboo--

Bidding any job is best done on a job to job basis--while square foot pricing' might be a good way to figure your costs before writing a proposal--I never let the customer see that---

To much else goes into figuring the cost of a job---second floor ? Third floor?

And then you get the smart butt customer that remeasures the building and finds a few less SF---Per window + per door + per square + per linear foot of fascia + per square of soffit + per piece of trim plus or minus for factor for complexity and number of cuts, rooflines, gables, etc. 

There is way too much variability from one building to the next not to account for higher and lower levels of complexity. 

If you bid by the square you might end up getting all the complex projects and lose all the simple and that will crush profitability because the more complex projects take longer and generate more waste.www.PoleBarnBuilder.com www.PoleBarnsNY.com

Pole barn builders in NY WNY CNY - Pole barns for sale in NYtree fidy sounds goodThanks for your input guys.When I do it both are taken into consideration. How squares of siding , ease of install, plus if I am able to use my manlift to do the job. But when the customer gets the bid it is by the completed job. And also all material on the job belongs to me, so any thing left over is mine.I charge as much as possibleOriginally Posted by Celtic 
Like I said...I'm sure you are very good at what you do ~ whatever that is and where ever it happens.I price jobs by production. Depending on the job, our siding crew might get 2 square an hour or 1/2 square an hour.

When I get to the end I check what my cost is per square. If I'm really high or low to look back at my production and make sure I'm not making a mistake.

Over time, this is how you develop your unit costs. But you need to accurately track your production. Then you can compare to your bid and see where things either went well, were status quo, or were a bust.-JohnDo like most of us have done, try one way and go from there if you lose your butt try something different.
What works for one person might not work for you.I figure the time, material, profit, and overhead. Then I usually go back and see what it is per sq. Just for reference. 
Replacement windows are the only thing I figure per unit. I have a price for 1st floor and a higher price for 2nd floor. I keep in mind anything that would make the job harder. Large shrubs in front of the windows for example. Then I adjust the price from there. The number of windows will affect the cost per unit also. 
There is a website that shows building/remodeling costs by zip code. Try googleing "cost calculator + by zip code" It will come up. I looked at yesterday. I don't go by that, but I do keep in mind what it says, in case a customer has been looking at install prices on the internet. It's not too far off.I went to double check my measurements for a storm door replacement and realized that the vinyl J channel was installed over the storm door flange.

They do things like that because tool pouch and hammer is cheap at lowes than bam their a carpenter.I know the job is probably done already, but I had one like this a while back. I caught a break though and was able to leave the existing z-bar and hinges on the jamb. Weatherstrip looked good, no metal streaks on hinge and client was OK with doing it that OK . 

Maybe not the best, but an option.

AndyAny suggestions/methods for addressing the floor joist to wall connection gaps/passage for dense packing the walls? The second floor would be the only concern as they are hardwood floor. Attic floor and basement allow for easy access to add blocking and seal it up.Remodeling Contractor Scranton PA

Scranton PA Kitchen RemodelingBiggest trick I see is drilling a hole in each bay - using an onion bag & blowing that full to act as a big plugSLS Construction & Building Solutions LLC Our Blog - The HTRCusually you can just pack the bottom and top of the wall with fiberglass batts and blow the 2 stories one story at a time - normal drill and fill.. I haven't seen the onion sack approach.I think I misread the question. Rereading, it looks like the question is specifically where the floor joists are. I haven't seen anything done specifically for that. In a usual drill and fill, it blows out over the ceiling a ways, but it's loose in that area.Hdavis, trying to minimize that. The openings to the joist cavity are significant. Hard to tell how much materials waste there would be, plus I don't like the idea of having the void that could potentially cause the insulation above to settle. From my limited experience with cellulose, it does seem to stay tight, but would rather not have to be concerned about failure. 

The bag is a perfect idea. So simple. I can't believe that I didn't think about that. I have a bunch of sandbags that could work great to stuff in there.Remodeling Contractor Scranton PA

Scranton PA Kitchen RemodelingI'm filing that trick away,thanks, SLS:thumbsup:My pleasure guys - with that Phil I am not sure sandbags will work but would love to hear your results. The two biggest items I see is it might not be big enough to fully lock in and act as a plug & the biggest item is being able to hold onto it. The onion/produce bags work so well because they allow the air to escape easily, and along those lines mold easily to the cavity space. Good luck & let us know how you doSLS Construction & Building Solutions LLC Our Blog - The HTRCI think I still have some big ones. I used them when digging out inside basements.

I will update when done. Hoping to get things locked down for July.Remodeling Contractor Scranton PA

Scranton PA Kitchen RemodelingCurrently I'm doing a remodel project out of state and have had quite the complications with the counter-top fabricator. 

First off, I chose them because I didn't know any of the local tradesmen or contractors to go through and they had quite the reputation and a portfolio of even greater magnitude. 

The problem with this installer started when the owner showed up to take measurements and he stormed out because I didn't frame my under-mounts in the cabinets. He didn't seem to understand that the sinks were going to be on center with the width of the cabinet unit, depth then based on template to reduce excessive lip toward the front of the counter top. 

He stormed out telling me not to call him until I boxed in the sinks with 2x4s...

This was a shock because I usually draft out my own plans for the material and have the material fabricated at their shop with nothing more than a payment for material and that's it. No biggy. 

Then, the foreman came out to remeasure, and he was all confused as to why the sinks were framed in place and also forgot to measure for a soap niche in the second bathroom. So, they accepted my dimensions via e-mail; this being the narrowest piece. 

They didn't do any of the cutouts for the fixtures and I had to do all the measurements, onsite, when I clearly told the sales team how I wanted them fabricated, all on center with the cab units and sinks. 

After install, since they were going to use standard construction adhesive, instead of a water-resistant adhesive, I told them I'd install the caps and stools for the soap niches. 

They don't fit and fabrication was completely off by a whole inch on one of them. 

Also, the polishing wasn't complete on the faces and the backslashes weren't ripped to 3/4", instead the full 1-1/4" thick pieces were installed. I have never seen this done and looks way contemporary. 

Did I forget to mention after deposit was made and I tried to request a bevel at 3/8" radius, that the sales woman had no idea what I was talking about. 

Oh, and they damaged my new gyp and texture. 

The question is, how much should I school them, tell them I want repaired, replaced and remedied. I only have an additional two weeks till this unit is rented and there really isn't enough time to get them to take another two months to pull their heads out. 

Oh, I'm on an island too.In my limited experience with fabricated counters, they template all counters instead of taking measurements and drawing pictures. Once the templates are cut, they label each edge to spec desired finish, or what it butts to.

Just sounds like a communication breakdown between you and them as to what is taking place. Nothing quite like full scale labeled templates to look at when the counters show up to say, "Yup, exactly what we measured and agreed upon":laughing:We may not be fast, but we are expensive :blink:- I have never boxed out for a sink before the install.... I do this when they mount the sink to make sure that the 2x catches the flanges. 

- 1-1/4" back splash is standard around here.... Not my favorite look, and 9 out of 10 jobs I sell them on tile back splash. 

- The one thing you did not mention was if they templated or just took measurements? I used to work with a guy that took measurements and just drew it on a notepad..... No longer.... I will only work with companies that template. I did a huge kitchen island with a stepped arch radius and a farm sink and one overhang ended up 1" and the other one was 4", and the faucet hole is off center from where it was suppose to be. Everything gets templated and I am there that day. All the good companies do this anyways.... I have seen GPS done and its cool, but I still like templates more.

- As for missing a measurement... Sorry buddy get in the truck and drive back out here.... 

- The soap dishes not fitting... Sounds like your problem.... you should have at least dry fit them when the guys were there....sledhead54 said:

I've used probably 5 different fabricators here in CO. As SLED said, I thought everyone templated. (Some use heavy building paper, some sorta balsa type wood.

Never heard of having to frame in my sink before templating. I would have thought your soap dishes would have been called out as to size.

Where out of state are you?????

By the way, someone mentioned GPS for measuring/templating.... what is GPS (apart from what it normally is)

I think these guys ought to make everything good.... you ordered turnkey apparently, and they f'd up.

Good luck

I have bought pre-edged counter (simple install).... had a sink cut out to my dimensions... but I had their signiture on my measured directions to them. Your installer/fabricator is wrong.... by any standards I know.... sure his portfolio was not BS.Never stop learning (xcep fer speling en typeing):stupid:Granite guy I usually use uses four inch strips if corrugated plastic for his templates. A little hot glue and scissors gets it done fir him. 

Not sure if it's the GPS, but I used a guy for quartz once they sent a guy with a laptop on a tripod. It had an extendable articulating arm and he would swivel it around and map specific points on the counter. He sketched in the pc, then he mapped it with the arm. They claimed it was like rocket ship accurate. After the install crew went to work..... Let's just say I'd never hire them again. So I don't have a tin of faith in it. It seems like a great idea, but I'll go with the templates any day.Every time I've ever had granite or quartz installed, it was always computer templated.

I always give the sink to the countertop guys and they mount it at their shop after they cut the hole. 

They won't start the tops until you give them the sink and faucet around here.-JohnHow do you sign off on a computer template? I & customer approve template, overhangs, projections, corner details, detail near fridge, detail near slide in range etc. If no actual template then what?
Too many possibilities for problems. Template comes back with install, to compare if there is a problem.
I have to have sink, faucet, appliances on site before templating
Rarely have sink mounted at their shop unless it is a vanityMy stone guys come in and do thier own templates and install. We do our own templates for laminates and solid surface which we label the hell out of and accompany with pictures, sinks and faucets when we drop off at fabricators. They mount sinks and drill faucet holes and we install tops and build frame out for sinks after install is complete. Either way if we negotiated a deal then I expect them to support thier end of it. I am sure they appreciate when I support my end of the deal and pay the bill. If they do not perform then I do not pay or if they really get me fired up I will backcharge to cover my costs to fix it for them.TAHomeRepairs said:

I had granite guys do my vanity top and whirlpool ledge this winter and they just came back to do my kitchen. They used this set up http://www.laserproductsus.com/products/lt-55-xl-laser-templator/

The bath turned out perfect.
I guess I'll see how the kitchen comes out. 75sq ft.
They do all the install. I just hook up the drain and water lines. The templating guy just gets the manufacturer and model numbers of sinks faucets, etc. and said they have all the dimensions in a data base in their shop.
He goes over in detail how everything is going to fit and be installed before I sign off on the design.Trump-The "Con Man's" Con Man.I don't know who you called, but like the rest here I never framed anything up.

They come with strips of plywood, layout the template, if they don't provide a sink, they will use your sink for cutout, hot glue and staple everything together and that is it.

I would call someone else who knows what they doing.I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​TimNJ said:

You sign off on the drawing? I would never do it that way, many customers cannot visualize overhangs, size of shapes etc. Then when the top comes the " I did not think it would be that shape/big/small etc" leaves you screwed.
With laminate tops they were cheap enough to do over, not with granite or solid surface.Of course I signed off.
I also don't see why most customers wouldn't.
Everything is described as in sink and cook top locations, sink reveal, number and location of faucet borings, edge detail, overhang size, seam locations.

I wouldn't be a fabricator and not have the customer sign off. That would open the door to big problems with that 1% of picky lunatics.Trump-The "Con Man's" Con Man.TimNJ said:

My point is the customers not understanding how close a 12" overhang will be to nearby cabinet in a heavily trafficed area, or how exactly a 6" radius on the overhang looks compared to a 10" radius. Until they actually see the physical size of the top they sometimes don't understand how close/far it is.That's why it is the job of the fabricator to school them.
As with any sale, some customers need hand holding. You explain everything in detail. If they don't understand it, it will be a problem no matter what.

"I want a 12x12 deck". Until you explain how small a 12x12 deck is, then they want bigger.

Actually, I take that back. It is the job of the sales person to school the customer. The customer should have been shown all the options and details on display in the showroom. Then the customer makes the decision.
The fabricator confirms at the job in case any odd ball barriers pop up.Trump-The "Con Man's" Con Man.I can make a deck bigger/ smaller I can't easily change a top on site a day or two before job completion.I have had 4 different types of measure done on counters. 

First ever guy i used had a gadget where it was on a tripod and a pen with a cable to the tripod. It some how calculated the layout. end product came out fair. Not perfect but acceptable.

2nd guy used a articulating arm gizmo. Had the same result as above but it was a very basic layout. 

3rd guy took measurements. Never ever ever will i use a company who uses this method. They cut the counters wrong 3x and one of the times i even went to the shop to tell them what they needed to do to adjust the counter and they still cut it wrong. They ended up telling my customer to shove it and get another company to do it a few days before thanksgiving.

4th guy used a template made from that sign plastic with hot glue. Counter came out perfect and was even able to view the over hangs and layout before they left to cut. Couldn't have got a better install if they tried.www.thecoastalcraftsman.comrrk said:

All the more reason the customer should be made aware of what they picked out before it is made.

I don't think a fabricator wants to make a counter then have the customer say they didn't want that.

Customer signs off on what they are getting. No different than if customer signs off for me ordering an Andersen patio door. They signed for it in the contract and if they want Pella afterwards oh well, they have to pay for it since they signed for Andersen.

My advice is find one fabricator that you know does work properly and stick with them. Don't shop around for them anymore than you would shop around for a plumber or electrician on every job you do.Trump-The "Con Man's" Con Man.You can see the exact door you choose in a showroom, you cannot see an exact countertop for your kitchen in a showroom. The closest you can get is to see the exact mock of your countertop in your house. Door is $1500 which can sometimes be returned/sold/used elsewhere. Granite top is $5000, cannot be returned, or sold for close to cost.
I prefer to limit the possibility of errors and communication problems, it has worked for me for a very long time, it has worked for my supplier who has been doing granite for a very long time, and I have used him for 10 years now.Then you should have your customer go to the fabricators and do their own slab lay out. If a fabricator won't let your customer do the pattern lay out, get a new fabricator. Otherwise you will end up with "I don't like that color spot there. I want a new counter."

I won't return anything unless the customer pays for the new item...in advance. 

Do you not print out a spec sheet that details everything that will be done and materials used on your jobs and have your customer sign it?Trump-The "Con Man's" Con Man.TimNJ said:

Who said anything about color or spots?

I dont know how to explain it any better so you can understand. 
It has to do with the size/shape of the top, some customers cannot visualize a 12" overhang vs. a 10" overhang, a 42" wide clearance vs. 48" wide clearance, a 6" radius vs. a 8" radius. 
Sooooo, when the top is templated with a physical template they can see how the 42" clearance feels and see exactly what the 8" radius looks like on their dogleg island overhang with the custom $3000 artist made column.
For me and them there are no surprises thenI'm remodeling a new store for a friend of mine ,its my first time using steel studs.it was much easier than i thought,didn't even have to cut too much,we used full size 10's and 12's for the walls.Took more time to plan for the theater room than it took to frame half the store,Its going to be a high end store :theater,audio and video. built a big office,a small office,three closets,a conference room and a 19' x 21' theater room.i'm going back tommorow to frame out the theater room ceiling and build a two level stage for the seating.The theme is going to be roman ,we got some awsome plans for that in the up coming weeks.I'm very excited and can't wait to warm up my table saw.:clap:Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.I have never seen a wall built with steel layed on the floor like that.

When the walls don't go all the way up to the top deck, the way to build them is on the floor and then tie each wall into the others. Goes VERY quickly like that.

Yea first time , we had 14'-15' to the roof ,really nothing to attatch to,and theater room was 12' the rest was 10' ,so we installed all the perimiter walls first anchored the tops to the cinder block with heavy L-brackets and used 3/8 hollow wall anchors,the type that flip out in the wall,tried tapcons but the block was old and crumbly.then just ran some braces acrossed the top plates to keep them level and sqaure.my biggest problem was he wanted a two level "wood framed" ceiling ,i thought a little too heavy for the steel studs,so we took advantage of the girders and wedged 2x8's in them and kind of hung the ceiling at the transition off of them.It didn't help the wood came from the lumber yard awfully heavy from the 4" of rain we just got.I've never felt 2x8's weigh so much.i'll post more pics tommorow when i finish the seating platformLearning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.hrscammisa said:

Yes, I can see your point and how this is very quick as well.

I guess it all depends on the design and function of the space. 

Medical areas require going to the top deck (soundproofing)
Some office layouts just want open partition walls = No ceilings.
Etc...- Build Well -Off the metal and on to the wood

Finished up the metal framing,and just finish up the wood framing yesterday got the theater room seating platform done,the platform will have an arch over it with two collums sitting on the knee wall,ceiling with projector lift opening done.just waiting for the electrician to finish and then the drywall,in the mean while i'm trying to design something for the theater room screen wall,we've pick a roman theme.I found an idea i'm going to build and have the screen drop down out of. I'm excited and can't wait to get started on it.Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.Working with steel is so easy. im currently doing a commercial space where the owner made many changes with the layout.

Working with steel is so easy. im currently doing a commercial space where the owner made many changes with the layout. I practically moved entires walls with ease. Try that with wood.

You aren't kidding its very forgiving,i have a basement renovation coming up soon,i will definately use it again on this project.:thumbup:Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.I love steelOnly had a chance to use steel studs a couple times but do like them.Especially when you hang the board.I wished they used more of them them in my area.
Nice looking job.I'm a big fan of steel studs. On the office I'm design/building right now, we did wood exterior walls and trusses and steel interior studs. It's fast, straighter, and the drywaller like it better.

I've also never seen the walls framed on the ground like that.-JohnIs it possible to replace a tub unit of the same size without removing a wall?

Only thing I can think of is to do a drop in tub??? I want to sell them a tile shower but first I need to figure out if getting a new tub or shower in there is even an option or physically possible. 

Existing tub is 52 between the walls so it is probably 54 on the outside, which is somewhat standard.

This is the layout:Lewis CarpentryPics.Lewis CarpentryYou don't need to remove a wall but you do need to remove the bottom course of tile as the flange is probably nailed to the wall studs.You want to sell a tile shower as in all the way to the floor with a prefab pan? If so, but sure I understand why you need a new tub to fit.

As to how it can work, tubs are short enough that we have been able to bring them in standing up and lay them down after removing some drywall for it to stick into the wall some.

Assuming it would be a type where you would have a 2x4 platform support on the back and sides, the front is the only part that continues all the way to the floor. The only problem I see in your pics is the vanity doesn't give much working room depending on placement of studs in the wall.Spencer, that tub should have a flange running around the outside that sits either against the studs or against the drywall / backer board / however it was done. Those tiles would be installed over the flange. Maybe you could get another tub in there after you demo to the studs without pulling more stuff out of the bathroom as long as you can unhook the tub control and move it out of the way.

I'll take another look at the picture.If you want the tile to remain in tact with the exception of the bottom row, the vanity and toilet need to come out... in that room, no other choice...

Best of luck... 8^)OK, so this looks like it may go the same way my last one did. Stud placement counts. Take off bottom row of tile, find studs at the foot of the tub. Take a vertical column of tilesand backer / drywall off at the stud bay closest to the vanity - two rows may be needed. Unfasten tub flange from walls, and rotate the back edge up and toward you (this is really awkward) to get the bottom front edge of the tub to line up with the stud bay you opened up. Rotate the tub clockwise to get it vertical, then take it out.

Reverse the process to install a new one.

A lot easier to write it than to do it. I've actually had to cut the drywall on the other side of the wall to take one out and put a new one in.

Sometimes the smartest thing is to check the other side of that wall to see where studs and wires are before you commit. In your case, letting people know how hacked up this will be can help.KAP said:

And at least some of the base mold...

I don't see that he'll have room to rotate it once he clears those locations, so I think there still will be wall cutting involved.hdavis said:

The reason the toilet and vanity come out (disconnect/reconnect) is not so much for coming out (original tub can be cut out), but for the going in (walk it it and set it)... pop the left leg of the casing off and any base molding.

If the going is in too tight, remove the rock to the right to gain additional space...

But if he pre-measures, this will tell him what needs to be done... 

Ripping walls/studs apart is the longer way to do it... not saying it won't be necessary, but I would avoid it at all costs for a simple disconnect/reconnect...Sorry, I need to clarify. 

The reason for removing the tub is because it looks old but more importantly because the tile on the wall are falling off and failing.

The surround needs replaced also.

There is no point in tearing this much up in there and not replacing the floor with tile also, so the vanity will get removed. 

If there was no skirt on the tub I would think I could get it in there, but the square skirt is gonna cause the problems and it only makes sense that there would be studs right in line with the skirt.Lewis CarpentryKAP said:

Agreed, but he can see the tub sitting there, so pulling it is a decent exercise in making sure his prep will allow the new one to fit, assuming they're the same size. If the flanges are on the studs, he'll be taking a lot of that drywall off both sides on top of removing the vanity and toilet.

Ones like this just boil down to which set of hassles he (and the HO) wants to live with. Lots of tile repair, or yank fixtures, base cut out sheet rock, etc and put it back together.

If he wants to do a shower, he can just cut it up in place and avoid a lot of the take apart work.Spencer said:

That's why it has to be tipped to install. Have it up on end with the skirt toward you, bottom of the skirt to the left. With everything off to the studs, angle the unit to line the skirt up with the front stud bay at the foot of the tub. Now start rotating it down into position at the foot of the tub. The skirt will hit the drywall on the other side of that wall - the drywall will have to be cut to rotate it fully into position, and repaired once done. The last step is to rotate the back edge down to whatever ledger you have set up. If you don't have a ledger on that edge, it can slip down, and you'll pay h$ll getting your finger tips in between the edge and the wall to pick it back up.

Hope that explains it.hdavis said:

It's tougher to understand if you haven't done it (or seen it done) before.

This would be a typical manufactured home around here. The short tub I refer to as a trailer tub, since that's where they really got used a lot, but they're good for any tight layout.If the objective is to install a new tub AND retile, I don't understand the reason for this thread. Rip it out. Much more cathartic instead of trying to put lipstick on a pig.

Edit: if you're talking about the drywall outside the tub area, yes, it looks like you need to cut a couple feet out from the floor to slide the tub in. Maybe both walls. Maybe remove the door casing, too. Then you're free and clear. Otherwise, no dice.Spencer said:

 and you'll have to tear out about half the drywall to get the tub in there. You're tearing up more than half the bathroom anyway, might as well give them a price for a complete gut and remodel. Replacing only a bathtub in a bathroom doesn't make a lot of sense, it would be a lot of demo and money put into it for just the tub. Another option is to spray an epoxy coat on the old tub to make it look new. But if the tile is falling off the wall, good chance those studs in the wall have water damage so the studs would need to be replaced. But you won't know that until you tear up the drywall and look.MarkJames said:

The reason for the thread was because I was unsure that even if I tore out the drywall whether or not I would be able to maneuver the skirt of the tub into position being that it is square. Apparently others on here have done it with success it will just take some doing.

 I would print out a detail of the tub you want with dimensions, then meet with your plumber on site to make sure he can get it in.You need to pull the old tub out enough that the front skirt will clear any studs--then tip it up so the skirt goes into an open stud bay----

you are right---a tub is wider than the opening when measured on a diagonal across the skirt---that extra length need to go into an open stud bay---Here's some irony - short tubs like that have fewer choices of styles, and many cost more than a 60".

I helped a friend who had one of these in a similar situation, except he had a 2 piece surround glued onto the wall, which he wanted to keep (this was a manufactured home). The very worst part was lifting the shower surround off of the wall enough to be able to get the tub in. I'd never do that for a customer, but this friend is a different story - no charge. Another friend, it might have been double, and a new wall set would have gone in.Hey folks. Gutted bath room and pink tub is gone! I have a question on how to finish the gap in bullnose trim. I am installing bull nose around the tub surround. If you can picture this, if you are looking at the tub, on the right side you will be looking at the rounded edge of the bullnose where the partition is between the tub and closet. So what you will see straight on is a gap that will probably end up about 3/16 inch or so with the thin set.

I know I can get laticrete caulk to match the grout I will be using but I think even the best caulk job will just look wrong staring edge on at it. I'm wondering if I keep the thinset maybe a 1/2 inch short of the bullnose edge it would look far better if I can push drywall compound into that gap and paint it. The back side of the bullnose does have a joint similar to a rabbet joint that is about 1/16 x 3/16Fill with painters caulk and pull your paint line right into the edge of the bullnose. That will effectively "suck" the tile into the wall and give you the edge you are looking for. DO NOT use grout caulk, especially the sanded type as this will make painting a nightmare. DO NOT leave tile unsupported in any area without thinset underneath it, later additions of a shower door or robe hook etc. will crack the tile either when drilled or when fastened to.Thanks for the reply. Three hundred looks and it seems none have ever heard of this situation. Seems to me it would be quite common whenever bullnose tile meets drywall. 

I handled the situation somewhat the way you suggested.Glad I could help.I went out on an estimate Tuesday for a main bath and a master bath/bedroom remodel. The homeowner wants me to insulate all the interior walls of the bathrooms to help deaden those "restroom" noises. Any thoughts on the best way to do this? I was thinking just some good ole fiberglass will help, but is there anything out there better suited for this purpose? Thanks in advance for any help.

Here is a product you may want to check out: QuietRock Serenity exceeds code and commercial requirements for both Sound Transmission Class (STC) and fire ratings. Made from gypsum and infused with proprietary viscoelastic polymers that convert noise and vibration to tiny amounts of silent heat, QuietRock Serenity provides unprecedented soundproofing for party walls and ceilings in new construction and rehab projects. QuietRock is 5/8" thick and uses the same framing as standard drywall. The assembly provides STC ratings of 51-68 and pulls 20-30 dB out of low frequencies -- ideal for projects adjacent to railroad lines, airports and highways as well as party walls.

Also the following link offers various techniques and the level of effective results for ea application.

http://alsnetbiz.com/homeimprovement/faq10b.html

I hope this helps."We are continually faced with great opportunities which are brilliantly disguised as unsolvable problems." 
Margaret MeadQuiet Rock (expensive) or double-thickness of regular drywall with a sound-proofing caulking used between the two layers. There is also a product called MLV (mass loaded vinyl), two different thicknesses,one about 1/8" or another about 1/4" thick (better) that would go up between the studs and the drywall. All of the above items will help a lot but any of these items will also help. This is what many home theater users are doing. Also throwing up some poly-wrapped fiberglass would do better than the kraft faced fiberglass. The poly wrap, even as thin as it is, will absorb the sound better than the kraft and it aids in being a moisture barrier as well, to keep moisture out of the fiberglass. John Mansville makes the poly-wrapped in the 32 ft. rolls of R-13. Everything else I find down here is kraft paper based.Lenny V. - Come down and visit us in New Orleans and the 'burbs!:jester:What I learned from a clever carpenter, and I've done a couple times around rest rooms, is to take drywall cutoffs and add layers in the stud bays of the partition. Cut them so they fit snug in the bays and affix with adhesive and basically use the adhesive as a caulk around the edges to close gaps where sound can transmit.

It doesn't sound real hi-tech, but what you need to do is add mass and this does the trick. You can do a couple layers of extra drywall in the 3 1/2" space - just around electrical boxes its a little tricky so you might want to stuff some mineral wool or fiberglass around there.

Also make sure the bathroom door bottom is a really tight fit to a straight raised threshold - like 1/16" gap over a marble threshold is nice. That helps too.Build on a good foundation.You know... the more I think about this, what exactly is happening in this bathroom? If it's just the "tinkle" splashing noise in the toilet, why not put a small water garden fountain decoration on the back of the toilet which would always make the splashing noise which would mask any added splashing noises.

Now if it's adult hanky-panky in the jacuzzi, that they are trying to keep the kids from hearing, then you better go with ALL of the sound-proofing measures listed above.Lenny V. - Come down and visit us in New Orleans and the 'burbs!:jester:Tell the customer to give everyone outside the bathroom a pair of $1.99 ear plugs!

That should solve the problem... :cheesygriI am the liquor - Jim Lahey, Trailer Park SupervisorTo really perform sound deadening, you have to understand what it is you are trying to accomplish. Some materials absorb only certain frequencies, and let other frequencies pass. More material isn't always the answer, how you install the material is important.

The other posters have suggested the new products that install exactly like drywall, only much more expensive. Some have suggested doubling the thickness of the drywall, which is only partially correct. One other poster suggested MLV, which is probably getting more "correct", but it does come in many thicknesses, and again, it starts to get costly. 

Having had to deal with noise abatement problems, some of the theories are to isolate any sound transmission, which means that just slapping another piece of drywall does nothing because it will resonate to the rest of the materials. 

What does work is to isolate the two walls by staggering the studs on a 2x6 header and footer having no stud share both sides of the walls. The wall is now wider. Also, if even more is needed, use 2 2x3's instead of a 2x6 and run a bead of silicon caulk between the 2x3's effectively isolating the boards. Cut away the overhanging edge of the 2x4 stud at the top and bottom so it does not touch the other 2x3. Interweave insulation horizontally between the studs if you want to. Also run a bead of silcon caulk on each stud, let it dry, then install the drywall. If you want to add an additional layer, be sure to run a bead of silicon caulk between the two sheets, isolating the two pieces of drywall. Drywall alone will resonate sound easily. You could use cork or felt strips instead of the bead of silicon caulk.

There are also metal clips that you can install on a double thickness wall, where the clips hold the second sheet of drywall away from the first one, again isolating the two pieces from each other.

Also, seal up all the outlet holes in the walls, as sound transfers through the holes.

What you have done is isolate all the components so they cannot transfer sound between the materials.

Add up the costs. You will use double the studs and drywall in one method, also figure for double labor. Or consider the MLV or the Quietrock costs and see which makes more sense.I think for your purpose of trying to knock down some bathroom noise insulating the walls will be fine. If you want to go overboard try to pack as much insulation as you can in the wall. Insulation can and should be compressed for sound but not for r value. We always wrapped/ packed the pvc drain pipes for noise also. 

Of course there are more sophisticated sound proof tecniques as mentioned but that would be really overboard for a bath in my opinion.Wow! Tons of great suggestions guys. Thanks. 

As far as what's going on in the bathroom, there concern is that the bathrooms are back to back, and right off two bedrooms and the dinning area. The bathrooms are basically centrally located. So if someone is in the can making some #2 "noises" :laughing:, it can be heard at the dinner table.  I will look into prices on these options and give them the differences. Although I think they will end up with the poly wrapped fiberglass idea. This is not a high end job, so they will most likely be scared by the price of the high tech sound deading materials. But I'm sure that the poly wrapped fiberglass and caulking the studs before the drywall goes up will be a nice improvement. Thanks again for all the great help. 


JimJCW Residential Services
Heating - Cooling - PlumbingIf it's just the "tinkle, tinkle, little star" noises, then I would go with the water garden decoration that would basically create a white noise effect so that the actual #2 noise would not be heard. Those self-contained water garden decorations run around $20.00. If the owner doesn't want that, then start figuring out the best alternative above. 

Also, I recommended the double layer of drywall but I did say that sound-dampening caulking should be used between the layers to stop the resonation effect. That is the cheapest method and does raised the sound proofing value quite a bit. 

Google for sound proofing walls and sound proofing caulk and read some of the "scientific studies" about this method.

Or put the water garden/fountain in the dining room so the constant splashing will white noise out the tinkling.Lenny V. - Come down and visit us in New Orleans and the 'burbs!:jester:Get an el-cheapo really noisy exhaust fan that is wired with the light switch. That will drowned all the other noise happening in there.
Anyway, to add to the other posts, I read an article somewhere that also said to be sure to caulk the bottom plate along the floor because noise will travel past that joint.Trump-The "Con Man's" Con Man.I usually escape this by suggesting insulation for boat engine rooms. One look at the price will usually get you out. It's great if you do high-end home theaters.

I've tried the QuietRock and QuietShield insulation a couple of times, worthless in my estimation. Cheap but noneffective.

Like Bryan said, there is no simple answer.You can't solve you're problems with the same level of thinking that created the problems.

Wow.. must be some loud #2 noises. Tell the offensive offender to start taking Beano! And remember to tell them "No Farding" at the dinner table either! (No, I didn't spell it wrong, look up "Farding").Lenny V. - Come down and visit us in New Orleans and the 'burbs!:jester:The big issue is the door, generally. It's not sealed and there's a big gap underneath. The door is significantly inferior to even an un-insulated standard wall.

So for example, if the bath is the master bath, and we want to isolate the sound heard within the master bedroom, you have to deal with that door. It's really a waste to spend time & money on the walls without addressing the door. Your customer will be upset.

Water crashing noise can be alleviated with standard insulation (R13) and consider wrapping the PVC with Mass loaded vinyl (MLV). 

That generally does the trick.2X6 top and bottom plates, with 2X4 staggered studs, R19 insulation in between.... that seems to be the latest craze for bathroom walls, judging from the homes I've wired over the past few years.Bryan Weaver said:

Bingo! Building a (floating) room inside a room is the best way to eliminate crossover noise, though only lead can stop really low tones (like a loud, amplified bass guitar). But anyone who's tried to soundproof a studio can tell you that most building materials conduct sound well - the trick is to add air/empty space.

A recent edition of Fine Homebuilding addressed this very topic. Here's the link: http://www.taunton.com/finehomebuilding/pages/fh_184_055.aspTake a long, hard look at your elf.I believe Certainteed makes a sound deadening insulation, but on a 2x4 stud wall you can rock one side and force R19 in it. That will compact enough to deaden any sound that a bathroom could possibly make. If any one is any louder than that in a bathroom, they should maybe see a doctor.I can do the impossible right away.
Miracles take me a little longer.

Deck Fence Porch Builder TorontoTry recycled denim for sound reduction

I just installed recycled denim in a project. The material fills the cavities between the studs with no paper. it immediately seemed to absorb both the outside and inside sounds.Replace those hollow core doors with solid ones. As already mentioned, a sweep can possibly added to the bottom of the door - one with the multiple plastic ribs that can be trimmed. They aren't all that noticeable if done correctly. You can do a fiberglass drill and fill into the existing walls to cut back the noise quite a bit. Foam in the electric boxes and plumbing penetrations - air sealing cuts down on sound transmission.

In a finished normal full bath with tub and wall set, you usually have a big floor penetration for the bath drain. Lots of sound can get down through there.Hi Folks,

I've been following threads about various discussions regarding load bearing walls. There is a section of wall in a split entry home I recently purchased that I would like to remove. Refer to my profile photo for a picture of it (I've also attached a picture which I have wrote on to make it more clear). I want to remove it to make the space of the home feel larger. (It is a pic looking from the living room, into the dining room. The kitchen is only 6'x10' and is hidden behind the wall in question). 

The home inspector has told me the roof is a truss system. The distance the trusses span is around 22' (dimensions of the home are around 22'x40', it is a traditional split entry home). 

Based on knowing it is a truss system, the span which the trusses cover, and the fact that (as shown in the photo) there is no header for about an 8' wide section of the opening into the dining room, do you think the wall blocking the view of the kitchen could be removed without any concerns about it being load bearing? 

Please let me know if you have any more questions, I will try to answer as best as I can but I do not get the keys for a few more weeks and I'm trying to properly plan out all of my renovations so they are complete before we actually move in.

Thanks!There is no “dropped” beam in there. Doesn’t mean there is no “flush” beam. The fact that they are trusses means nothing.I love what I do and I'm very good at it!

Go poke your head in the attic and see what's there...but I'm voting not load bearing.The Following User Says Thank You to Inner10 For This Useful Post: Leo GNot likely but I don’t want him tearing that wall out on a “possible maybe”. The trusses could be designed to have the webs point load on that wall as well. There’s more to it than just whether there’s a beam or not. 

Get an engineer or take Inner’s word for it! Telling him to stick his head in the attic when he doesn’t know what he’s looking for is sound advice to be sure. :no:I love what I do and I'm very good at it!

Da Vinci on the web or Da Vinci On FacebookWhich way are the trusses running in relation to the wall?Get a picture of the truss system above that wall. It's very unlikely that it is loadbearing but could be. Heck the inspector might be completely wrong too.Trusses can be tricky.
Depending on the design they could be clear span or not.

When I put my house up all my trusses were designed for clear span.
With the exception that I have the original truss designs, I don't know how you could verify that. There is nothing on the truss itself.Trump-The "Con Man's" Con Man.DaVinciRemodel said:

http://www.facebook.com/FairfieldRemodelingOoo cool that sounds great thanks for the help everyone.Hmm just wondering what do you guys keep from sites if anything. Lol I don't know why but I find myself keeping something from every cool project like this like a trophy hahaha.I donate or throw everything away. It's not worth the time to keep. Besides copper pipe. I keep that :laughing:Ceezz said:

Basically nothing. Some stuff has value on Craigslist or as a donation. Other than that, free at the curb so I don't have to haul / pay for disposal or off to the dump it goes.Start down that road and we'll see you on Hoarders!

Hahaha I got ya. Dang I guess this is how it begins hahahaI just unloaded a set of cabinets from a Redo.Gone in three days.Picked up on site by someone else,no need to load up and move to landfill and pay their fees.
I had ran an ad on CL and a local Facebook page called Ct.Pickers,got about five calls in the first day.
Figured I made a days pay from what I sold them for and the time and expense of getting them to the landfill.
They were in worse shape than those you have there.
One call was from someone doing over a rental,couple for garage storage.they should be an easy sell.https://www.facebook.com/pages/John-Renza-DBA-Laurel-Remodeling/194183374011504I used to keep lots of stuff. Now if it isn't something I'm interested in like vintage light fixtures, I just toss it. I have acquired a few nice items over the years and keep them. Things like antique desks or chairs are usually given to me as a gift and I accept them in that spirit.

I used to think everything had a use. Then I had a yard full of crap. I don't do that anymore, well, not as much anyway. :whistlingEven if they're pretty rough, CL is great. There's a huge difference, it seems, between free and almost free. You can save on dump fees on just about anything as long as it's free. I make sure to stipulate, "I will not help load"You make something idiot proof and the world invents a better idiot.If something is nice, we'll donate to Habitat and put the customers name on the receipt. Give it to them with the bill. They appreciate that.

If it's just something we want gone that's a pain in the back, minimal value, but someone will take it (think of a 36" old tube tv or a big metal desk), we'll drag it to the curb with a big sign saying "FREE" - never fails. If it's copper, iron, etc. I put by my curb on trash day for the metal collector that comes by every week. Saves me a fee and he's out there making a buck.

Other than that, we haul to the dump and bet a coffee/soda on who can guess closest to the dump fee.

Every now and then, we'll find something interesting that we'll grab for kicks. This recent remodel, we found these heavy metal clips holing the back of a cast iron tub ( instead of a ledger board and nails). Probably common in the 50's, but we had never seen one.In addition to someone actually wanting them they would need to be a perfect fit. Not going to get a matching piece. I installed some used cabinets in my garage for storage.Habitat is a good thing. Craigslist works well also. Especially for kitchen cabinets. They will go quick. I would try for $1,000. For the most part, we set stuff by the curb. Sometimes it is gone within 10 minutes. On more than one occasion I will set something out and before I can make another trip, its gone. Patio door panels, windows, random cabinets, any type of metal, old appliances. (don't forget to remove the doors of refrigertors)
I always talk to the homeowner about what will happen to the stuff. I don't want them to think I was making a profit off of thier stuff. If they want to deal with it, I set the stuff in one location and they can mess with it when they want. 
I try to get rid of stuff as easy as possible and at the least amount of expense to me.
I try not to save anything. I've saved some junk for a while, but I usually get sick of looking at it and throw it away.New project with scissor trusses to match existing.

Of course good numbers on these Bigfoots means nothing without knowing the actual load imposed based on size of roof, deck, number of piers and ground snow load.

So instead of running off to the nearest box store I used oxiclean. Worked fine enough, but now it seems I have a slightly chalky residue on the walls ( oxidation layer Im guessing)

I must have spent an hour searching the interwebs about the effects of oxiclean on latex paint to little avail. Their website was no help in explaining why exactly not to use it.

No harm in giving it one more cleaning I guess. Wouldn't recommend using oxiclean without a separate rinsing solution before painting. It did do a good job at cleaning though I must admit.even with TSP, you have to rinse it.tipitop;2814937 said:

I would think you would want a open cell foam. 

Maybe foam rafters and create a hot roof on top
Many options here:
http://www.buildingscience.com/documents/reports/rr-0108-unvented-roof-systems/

or

Continuous baffles to the peak and use a roof 2-wall vent.

http://www.roof-2-wall.com/I've looked at building science's info, it's really great. I'm just so indecisive when I don't see one obviously "right" or "best" way to deal with something. I'll look at that other link, it's something I've never heard of. ThanksLet me throw in some food for thought... my brother spent about $8 grand having his attic completely reworked. They came in, sucked out all the insulation, sealed off all gable, soffit and ridge vents, then blew on the expanding foam on all exterior surfaces including the gables and the underside of the roof. 

We live in South Carolina and our summer days are typically in the mid 90's. If you go into a typical attic in the middle of the day here, it will be in the 130+ degree range.

He told me the temperature in his attic never varies more (or less during winter) than 7 or 8 degrees from his living space. He is very happy with the outcome and his energy bills are down considerably. So, with that, I recommend spraying the underside of the roof.Foam on top of the roof with a vent space for shingles above foam. Air seal it really well and blower door test it. Then you can put whatever you want in the rafter cavity as long as the dew point isn't in the rafter bay. Easiest approach is to spray with closed cell and call it a day.Morning Wood said:

I've got a SS bar sink with just two 4" center set faucet holes.

I need to mount a single hole center faucet, so I need to drill a 1-3/8 center hole in the sink.

Before I rip it up with experimentation, looking for your experience recommendation as to best bits/technique in drilling it... and not ripping it up.

I can't pull the sink, nor can I get any backing behind the faucet hole for drilling it.

I have no idea of the grade of SS, it's probably just a normal builders grade SS bar sink.

I've drilled SS with my cobalt twists before, but I need a 1-3/8 hole.

I'm sure my regular hole says won't do it, I do have my tile carbide grit hole saw.... but I don't want to experiment untill I know I won't rip it up.

Presently only have as biggest a 1" step bit.... but I suppose I can find locally a 1-3/8 step if that is a good approach.

Thought about drilling outside circle with cobalt twists and fileing smooth, but that just does not sound clean or practical.

Hope I don't have to order a specialty bit on the internet and wait on this, nor excessive expense for this that I probably won't run into again.

TIA for any recommendations

Drill a pilot hole and you can put the wrench side up for easy use.If you do not have access to a knock out punch, use the 1-3/8" hole saw to bore a hole in a 1-by or 2-by. Use 3M mounting tape to secure the template to the sink in the proper location. Pack the hole saw with ice or a wet sponge. Low speed, with the quality of stainless and gauge you'll be done in no time. Use the finest tooth hole saw you can find, do not use a lot of downward pressure, just enough for the teeth to do their work, you don't want it to grab and twist the metal.

As mentioned, a KO-punch/slug-buster was not realistically available to me.... and could not find a Greenlee Carbide hole saw.... did seew some diamond ones... but did not think they'd work on SS and were $55.

So... drilled a pilot with a 1/4 cobalt... relatively easy... tried both my tile carbide grit 1-3/8 and a bimetal (not new or very sharp).... they might have made it through eventually.... kept it lubed and cool, but could not get my weight on it...

So I tried my step bit.... cut/went like a champ.....

States adopt a models code (IRC, etc.) and local municipalities have the right to adopt something better than the model code that is just a minimum standard.

Yeah, im aware of sizing and location height requirements.

The part I'm hung up on ( in all the basements I've done in PA this is not the case ) is the code seems to only require "egress" for sleeping rooms.

If you wanted real estate credit for an additional bedroom for the house then yes you need one. If you tell them, "they might use it as a bedroom", then its going to be hard for the official to ignore it. Even rooms without doors. In the name of public safety they cant turn their head but even if he insists, it could be challenged at the board of appeals.

You are allowed to have a rec room, an office ect... and no one can tell you how you should finish a room.Again its different in different jurisdications. Some guys will say no because they dont believe you or dont want to see it become one after the fact. But I think Board of Appeals may feel different.

If you think its going to be a bedroom sell it if you can,for everyone involved. If not ask the code offical the correct way.It is a zoning issue as to what the room is classified as. The building code says if it is a bedroom then it needs a means of egress.

The zoning dept makes the call on what the room is classified as, does it have a door? Closet? either one may trigger bedroom classification. I did one where you could have closet, door, full bath but no other sink including a bar sink. Then they said it would turn into a bedroom.

Every town is different in regards to zoning. Many towns have building dept walk through's when ever the house is sold just to catch these things.What does zoning have to do with it? It not a 1 family 2 family thing or legal apartment dwelling its usable space. 
I keep an nj administrative book up to date. I will look in it later.I have never gone through zoning, on a single family residence, that I wasn't changing the footprint on.Tom M said:

Every building permit has to go through the zoning dept first before it even gets to the building dept. Many towns have weird rules on where bedrooms can be located, how many kitchens, number of bedrooms per house sq footage, which way the garage door faces, etc. There are so many zoning rules in some towns it's crazy.

I know of one town where no bedroom can be located on the 3rd floor if the 1st floor is habitable living area having a bedroom. They define what is a habitable living area having a bedroom. The next town over is no problem. Part of 1 town you can't have a garage door facing the street.I know towns have loads of little quirky rules. Zoning is about the footprint or change of occupancy. They are rules for what gets credit for a 3rd story additional the structure is Type VA or VB. They created another mess by Wind loads & building height when they asked people to lift the houses down the shore.In most jurisdictions in Colorado, if it has a closet – it’s a bedroom. No closet it’s an office, rec. room, playroom…I love what I do and I'm very good at it!

And conformity by not allowing change of use, I think the term is zoning review. Some towns its free some its $30. If you look on the permit after its approved there is a check box that should be initialed after zoning review. 

Never thought about raised houses down there, that could cause some problemsHere we have many raised houses or multi-level splits.

When it comes to selling, it takes an egress window to count as a bedroom(livable space) to include in the livable space for appraisals and does affect how much money a person can borrow on a purchase. That difference can rule out many purchases that are on the "edge", valuation-wise. Here, an egress window is usually a selling point.

Closet or no closet, it is a bedroom here since some people go the European route and use furniture (finished wardrobe).Dick

You beat me to it. A closet makes a difference here as well.220...221...whatever it takes!Tom M said:

Right, they are grandfathered in. But now if you convert an attic to a bedroom in a cape you have to meet all of those restrictions.

About 10-15 years ago for 1 or 2 years if you did any permitted work in that attic you had to make sure the entire attic met current codes including the stairs. Everybody went nuts and the rules were changed quickly. Thats when they came up with the Rehab Subcode.Here you go, I hope it helps :thumbsup:I never lost a cent on the jobs I didn't get!​What did they say Kambrooks?

I keep an adminstrative code book for the State. The book modifies the IRC. In this particular section 310 the code reads: Basements, attics with habitable spaces and every sleeping rooms shall have emergency escape...blah blah blah.

In NJ they delete "Basements, attics with habital spaces and" So the code is read starting with every sleeping room. They made a point of doing this. If you tell me they modified this locally Im going to throw this subscription out. There is no definition of sleeping room because it can happen anywhere.I have a client who is looking to replace the cabinets at a bar in their house. They have granite that was installed on the 20 year old cabinet by the previous owner last year. So I am dealing with old cabinets, nice granite. The big question is whether on not I can get the granite side and backsplash off? The client would like to have tile and it have 4" of granite on the wall the granite. Any ideas on how to get the backache me side splash pieces off the granite? I assume they are probably bonded and not just silicone. Also, if they come off, will it be noticible on the granite?

Thanks,

MikeWhat are they stuck to? Drywall? 
Even 20 years back, they used silicone against the wall--often nothing at all between the counter top and the back splash---

Just a small bead of silicone where they meet---

Use a painters tool as a wedge/pry bar and pull off the back splash---wood shims can be used also---some polishing might be needed to clean up the newly exposed part.The backsplash should just be attached to the wall with an adhesive and then clear silicone where the backsplash and countertop meet.

It very well could be a difference in where the counter was covered with the backsplash and where it wasn't due to wear and tear on the exposed portion. Some mild buffing and sealing should take care of it so it will not be too noticeable.

BTW head on over to the intro section and let us know who we are talkn to. :thumbsup:My tools are always yelling at me cause the wife and kids take up too much room.Agree with above, but 1 year old granite probably won't show any wear under the splashes. And yes, intro's are good !!!If the countertop wasn't cut tight to the wall there might be a up to a 1" gap.olzo55 said:

If there's a gap, it will likely be visible from the front.
